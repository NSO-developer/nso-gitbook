# 1. General
------------

  This document describes the juniper-junos_nc NED.

  IMPORTANT:
  This NED is delivered without any of the device YANG models bundled to the NED package.

  It is required to download the YANG files separately and rebuild the NED package before the NED is
  fully operational. See the README-rebuild.md for further information.

  In summary, the below steps are needed to have a fully functioning NED:

  ```
  1.  Compile the empty package and load it into NSO
  2a. Connect to device and fetch yang modules (if yang available on device or in git repository)
  2b. Copy vendor yang directly into src/yang (if yang is available elsewhere)
  3.  Verify yang, potentially fixing any issues
  4.  Re-Compile package (i.e. in NSO), and do packages reload
  ```

  ```


## 1.1 Extract the NED package
------------------------------

  It is assumed the NED package `ncs-<NSO version>-juniper-junos_nc-<NED version>.signed.bin` has already
  been downloaded from software.cisco.com.

  In this instruction the following example settings will be used:

  - NSO version: 6.0
  - NED version: 1.0.1
  - NED package downloaded to: /tmp/ned-package-store

  1. Extract the NED package and verify its signature:

      ```
      > cd /tmp/ned-package-store
      > chmod u+x ncs-6.0-juniper-junos_nc-1.0.1.signed.bin
      > ./ncs-6.0-juniper-junos_nc-1.0.1.signed.bin
      ```

  2. In case the signature can not be verified (for instance if no internet connection),
     do as below instead:

      ```
      > ./ncs-6.0-juniper-junos_nc-1.0.1.signed.bin --skip-verification
      ```

  3. The result of the extraction shall be a tar.gz file with the same name as the .bin file:

      ```
      > ls *.tar.gz
      ncs-6.0-juniper-junos_nc-1.0.1.tar.gz
      ```


## 1.2 Install the NED package
------------------------------

  There are two alternative ways to install this NED package.
  Which one to use depends on how NSO itself is setup.

  In the instructions below the following example settings will be used:

  - NSO version: 6.0
  - NED version: 1.0.1
  - NED download directory: /tmp/ned-package-store
  - NSO run time directory: ~/nso-lab-rundir

  A prerequisite is to set the environment variable NSO_RUNDIR to point at the NSO run time directory:

  ```
  > export NSO_RUNDIR=~/nso-lab-rundir
  ```

  **IMPORTANT**:

  This NED is delivered as an “empty” package, i.e without any device YANG models bundled.
  It must be rebuilt with the device YANG models to become operational.

  The procedure to rebuild the empty NED (described in the README-rebuild.md) shall typically
  be done in a lab environment. For this step a “local install” of the NED shall be used.
  It is not suitable to use “system install” here since it is intended for production systems only.

  Once this NED has been rebuilt with the device YANG and exported to one or many
  separate tar.gz customized NED packages, a “system installation” can be used on them.


### 1.2.1 Local install
-----------------------

  This section describes how to install a NED package on a locally installed NSO
  (see "NSO Local Install" in the NSO Installation guide).

  It is assumed the NED package has been been unpacked to a tar.gz file as described in 1.1.

  1. Untar the tar.gz file. This creates a new sub-directory named:
     `juniper-junos_nc-<NED major digit>.<NED minor digit>`:

     ```
     > tar xfz ncs-6.0-juniper-junos_nc-1.0.1.tar.gz
     > ls -d */
     juniper-junos_nc-gen-1.0
     ```

  2. Install the NED into NSO, using the ncs-setup tool:

     ```
     > ncs-setup --package juniper-junos_nc-gen-1.0 --dest $NSO_RUNDIR
     ```

  3. Open a NSO CLI session and load the new NED package like below:

     ```
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin
     admin@ncs# packages reload
     reload-result {
         package juniper-junos_nc-gen-1.0
         result true
     }
     ```

  Alternatively the tar.gz file can be installed directly into NSO. Then skip steps 1 and 2 and do like
  below instead:

  ```
    > ncs-setup --package ncs-6.0-juniper-junos_nc-1.0.1.tar.gz --dest $NSO_RUNDIR
    > ncs_cli -C -u admin
    admin@ncs# packages reload
    reload-result {
      package juniper-junos_nc-gen-1.0
      result true
   }
  ```

  Set the environment variable NED_ROOT_DIR to point at the NSO NED package:

  ```
  > export NED_ROOT_DIR=$NSO_RUNDIR/packages/juniper-junos_nc-gen-1.0
  ```


### 1.2.2 System install
------------------------

  This section describes how to install a NED package on a system installed NSO (see "NSO System
  Install" in the NSO Installation Guide).

  It is assumed the NED package has been been unpacked to a tar.gz file as described in 1.1.

  1. Do a NSO backup before installing the new NED package:

     ```
     > $NCS_DIR/bin/ncs-backup
     ```

  2. Start a NSO CLI session and fetch the NED package:

     ```
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin
     admin@ncs# software packages fetch package-from-file \
               /tmp/ned-package-store/ncs-6.0-juniper-junos_nc-1.0.tar.gz
     admin@ncs# software packages list
     package {
      name ncs-6.0-juniper-junos_nc-1.0.tar.gz
      installable
     }
     ```

  3. Install the NED package (add the argument replace-existing if a previous version has been loaded):

     ```
     admin@ncs# software packages install juniper-junos_nc-1.0
     admin@ncs# software packages list
     package {
      name ncs-6.0-juniper-junos_nc-1.0.tar.gz
      installed
     }
     ```

  4. Load the NED package

     ```
     admin@ncs# packages reload
     admin@ncs# software packages list
     package {
       name ncs-6.0-juniper-junos_nc-gen-1.0
       loaded
     }
     ```


## 1.3 Configure the NED in NSO
-------------------------------

  This section describes the steps for configuring a device instance
  using the newly installed NED package.

  - Start a NSO CLI session:

    ```
    > ncs_cli -C -u admin
    ```

  - Enter configuration mode:

    ```
    admin@ncs# configure
    Entering configuration mode terminal
    admin@ncs(config)#
    ```

  - Configure a new authentication group (my-group) to be used for this device:

    ```
    admin@ncs(config)# devices authgroup group my-group default-map remote-name <user name on device> \
                       remote-password <password on device>
    ```

  - Configure a new device instance (example: dev-1):

    ```
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 address <ip address to device>
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 port <port on device>
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 device-type generic ned-id juniper-junos_nc-gen-1.0
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 state admin-state unlocked
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 authgroup my-group
    ```
    **IMPORTANT**:

    The *device-type* shall always be set to *generic* when configuring a device instance
    to use a 3PY NED. A common mistake is configuring it as *netconf*, which will cause
    NSO to use its internal netconf client instead.


  Junos netconf/yang compliance configuration

  Junos devices can be configured to support netconf/yang in two different modes.
  Either in a legacy, non-compliant mode or, in a compliant mode. Historically
  Juniper didn't publish any yang-models, hence Cisco provides the "legacy"
  juniper-junos NED package which contains a generated yang model, including some
  proprietary yang extensions to be able to handle some of the non-compliant
  parts.

  The configuration on the device which decides which mode it operates in are
  found in the container /configuration/system/services/netconf.

  This NED is designed to target Junos devices running in rfc compliant mode.

  Set the below config on the device to make it operate in a compliant mode:
  ```
      set system services netconf rfc-compliant
      set system services netconf yang-compliant
  ```
  For more information on the compliance settings in Junos see:

      https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/netconf/topics/ref/statement/rfc-compliant-edit-system-services-netconf.html
      https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/netconf/topics/ref/statement/yang-compliant-edit-system-services-netconf.html

  - Finally commit the configuration

    ```
    admin@ncs(config)# commit
    ```

  - Verify configuration, using a sync-from.

    ```
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 sync-from
    result true
    ```

  If the sync-from was not successful, check the NED configuration again.


# 2. Optional debug and trace setup
-----------------------------------

  It is often desirable to see details from when and how the NED interacts with the device(Example: troubleshooting)

  This can be achieved by configuring NSO to generate a trace file for the NED. A trace file
  contains information about all interactions with the device. Messages sent and received as well
  as debug printouts, depending on the log level configured.

  NSO creates one separate trace file for each device instance with tracing enabled.
  Stored in the following location:

  `$NSO_RUNDIR/logs/ned-juniper-junos_nc-gen-1.0-<device name>.trace`

  Do as follows to enable tracing in one specific device instance in NSO:


  1. Start a NSO CLI session:

     ```
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin
     ```

  2. Enter configuration mode:

     ```
     admin@ncs# configure
     Entering configuration mode terminal
     admin@ncs(config)#
     ```

  3. Enable trace raw:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 trace raw
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

     Alternatively, tracing can be enabled globally affecting all configured device instances:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices global-settings trace raw
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  4. Configure the log level for printouts to the trace file:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 ned-settings juniper-junos_nc logger \
                       level [debug | verbose | info | error]
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

     Alternatively the log level can be set globally affecting all configured
     device instances using this NED package.

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device global-settings ned-settings juniper-junos_nc logger \
                       level [debug | verbose | info | error]
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  The log level 'info' is used by default and the 'debug' level is the most verbose.

  **IMPORTANT**:
  Tracing shall be used with caution. This feature does increase the number of IPC messages sent
  between the NED and NSO. In some cases this can affect the performance in NSO. Hence, tracing should
  normally be disabled in production systems.


  An alternative method for generating printouts from the NED is to enable the Java logging mechanism.
  This makes the NED print log messages to common NSO Java log file.

  `$NSO_RUNDIR/logs/ncs-java-vm.log`

  Do as follows to enable Java logging in the NED

  1. Start a NSO CLI session:

     ```
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin
     ```

  2. Enter configuration mode:

     ```
     admin@ncs# configure
     Entering configuration mode terminal
     admin@ncs(config)#
     ```

  3. Enable Java logging with level all from the NED package:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# java-vm java-logging logger com.tailf.packages.ned.junos \
                       level level-all
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  4. Configure the NED to log to the Java logger

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 ned-settings juniper-junos_nc logger java true
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

     Alternatively Java logging can be enabled globally affecting all configured
     device instances using this NED package.

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices global-settings ned-settings juniper-junos_nc logger java true
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  **IMPORTANT**:
  Java logging does not use any IPC messages sent to NSO. Consequently, NSO performance is not
  affected. However, all log printouts from all log enabled devices are saved in one single file.
  This means that the usability is limited. Typically single device use cases etc.

# 6. Built in live-status show
------------------------------

  The NED supports fetching operational data from the Junos /jc:configuration top node.


# 7. Limitations
----------------

    Limitations related to fetching operational data via the live-status API:

    NSO prior to version 5.6 can not handle lists defined in YANG as config false
    but with no key node specified.  Consequently the NED is not able to populate
    operational data that maps to such lists.


# 8. How to report NED issues and feature requests
--------------------------------------------------

  **Issues like bugs and errors shall always be reported to the Cisco NSO NED team through
  the Cisco Support channel:**

  - <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html>
  - <https://developer.cisco.com/docs/nso/#!support/network-service-orchestrator-support>

  The following information is required for the Cisco NSO NED team to be able
  to investigate an issue:

    - A detailed recipe with steps to reproduce the issue.
    - A raw trace file generated when the issue is reproduced.
    - Access to a device where the issue can be reproduced by the Cisco NSO NED team.
      This typically means both read and write permissions are required.
      Pseudo access via tools like Webex, Zoom etc is not acceptable.
      However, it is ok with device access through VPNs, jump servers etc though.

  Do as follows to gather the necessary information needed for your device, here named 'dev-1':

  1. Enable full debug logging in the NED

     ```
     ncs_cli -C -u admin
     admin@ncs# configure
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 ned-settings juniper-junos_nc logging level debug
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  2. Configure the NSO to generate a raw trace file from the NED

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 trace raw
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  3. If the NED already had trace enabled, clear it in order to submit only relevant information

     Do as follows for NSO 6.4 or newer:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 clear-trace
     ```

     Do as follows for older NSO versions:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices clear-trace
     ```

  4. Run a compare-config to populate the trace with initial device config

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 compare-config
     ```

  5. Reproduce the found issue using ncs_cli or your NSO service.
     Write down each necessary step in a reproduction report.

  6. Gather the reproduction report and a copy of the raw trace file
     containing data recorded when the issue happened.

  7. Contact the Cisco support and request to open a case. Provide the gathered files
     together with access details for a device that can be used by the
     Cisco NSO NED when investigating the issue.


  **Requests for new features and extensions of the NED are handled by the Cisco NSO NED team when
  applicable. Such requests shall also go through the Cisco support channel.**

  The following information is required for feature requests and extensions:

  1. A detailed use case description, with details like:
     - Data of interest
     - The kind of operations to be used on the data. Like: 'read', 'create', 'update', 'delete'
       and the order of the operation
     - Device APIs involved in the operations (For example: REST URLs and payloads)
     - Device documentation describing the operations involved

  2. Run sync-from # devices device dev-1 sync-from (if relevant)

  3. Attach the raw trace to the ticket (if relevant)

  4. Access to a device that can be used by the Cisco NSO NED team for testing and verification
     of the new feature. This usually means that both read and write permissions are required.
     Pseudo access via tools like Webex, Zoom etc is not acceptable. However, it is ok with access
     through VPNs, jump servers etc.


# 9. How to rebuild a NED
--------------------------

  Check the README-rebuild.md file, chapter 1.3, for more information.


# 10. Configure the NED to use ssh multi factor authentication
---------------------------------------------------------------

  This NED supports multi factor authentication (MFA) using the ssh authentication
  method 'keyboard-interactive'.

  Some additional steps are required to enable the MFA support:

  1. Verify that your NSO version supports MFA. This is configurable as additional
     settings in the authentication group used by the device instance.

     Enter a NSO CLI and enter the following and do tab completion:

     ```
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin
     admin@ncs# show running-config devices authgroups group default default-map <tab>
     Possible completions:
     action-name                 The action to call when a notification is received.
     callback-node               Invoke a standalone action to retrieve login credentials for managed devices on the 'callback-node' instance.
     mfa                         Settings for handling multi-factor authentication towards the device
     public-key                  Use public-key authentication
     remote-name                 Specify device user name
     remote-password             Specify the remote password
     remote-secondary-password   Second password for configuration
     same-pass                   Use the local NCS password as the remote password
     same-secondary-password     Use the local NCS password as the remote secondary password
     same-user                   Use the local NCS user name as the remote user name
     ```

     If 'mfa' is displayed in the output like above, NSO has MFA support enabled.
     In case MFA is not supported it is necessary to upgrade NSO before proceeding.

  2. Implement the authenticator executable. The MFA feature relies on an external executable to take care of the client part
     of the multi factor authentication. The NED will automatically call this executable for each challenge presented by the
     ssh server and expects to get a proper response in return.

     The executable can be a simple shell script or a program implemented in any programming language.

     The required behaviour is like this:
      - read one line from stdin
        The line passed from the NED will be a semi colon separated string containing the following info:
        ```
        [<device name>;<user>;<password>;<opaque>;<ssh server name>;<ssh server instruction>;<ssh server prompt>;]
        ```
        The elements for device name, user, password and opaque corresponds to what has been configured in NSO.
        The ssh server name, instruction and prompt are given by the ssh server during the authentication step.

        Each individual element in the semi colon separated list is Base64 encoded.

      - Extract the challenge based on the contents above.

      - Print a response matching the challenge to stdout and exit with code 0

      - In case a matching response can not be given do exit with code 2

     Below is a simple example of an MFA authenticator implemented in Python3:

     ```
     #!/usr/bin/env python3
     import sys
     import base64

     # This is an example on how to implement an external multi factor authentication handler
     # that will be called by the NED upon a ssh 'keyboard-interactive' authentication
     # The handler is reading a line from stdin with the following expected format:
     #   [<device name>;<user>;<password>;<opaque>;<ssh server name>;<ssh server instruction>;<ssh server prompt>;]
     # All elements are base64 encoded.

     def decode(arg):
         return str(base64.b64decode(arg))[2:-1]

     if __name__ == '__main__':
         query_challenges = {
             "admin@localhost's password: ":'admin',
             'Enter SMS passcode:':'secretSMScode',
             'Press secret key: ':'2'
         }
         # read line from stdin and trim brackets
         line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()[1:-1]
         args = line.split(';')
         prompt = decode(args[6])
         if prompt in query_challenges.keys():
             print(query_challenges[prompt])
             exit(0)
         else:
             exit(2)
     ```

  3. Configure the authentication group used by the device instance to enable MFA. There
     are two configurables available:
     - executable    The path to the external multi factor authentication executable (mandatory).
     - opaque        Opaque data that will passed as a cookie element to the executable (optional).

     ```
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin
     admin@ncs# config
     Entering configuration mode terminal
     admin@ncs(config)# devices authgroups group <name> default-map mfa executable <path to the executable>
     admin@ncs(config)# devices authgroups group <name> default-map mfa opaque <some opaque data>
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  4. Try connecting to the device.


## 10.1 Trouble shooting
------------------------
  In case of connection problems the following steps can help for debugging:

  Enable the NED trace in debug level:

  ```
  > devices device dev-1 trace raw
  > devices device dev-1 ned-settings juniper-junos_nc logger level debug
  > commit
  ```

  Try connect again

  Inspect the generated trace file.

  Verify that the ssh client is using the external authenticator executable:

  ```
  using ssh external mfa executable: <configured path to executable>
  ```

  Verify that the executable is called with the challenges presented by the ssh server:

  ```
  calling external mfa executable with ssh server given name: '<name>', instruction: '<instruction>', prompt '<challenge>'
  ```

  Check for any errors reported by the NED when calling the executable

  ```
  ERROR: external mfa executable failed <....>
  ```

# 11. Filtering yang schema to reduce size or handle overlaps
------------------------------------------------------------

  In some situations it might be convenient to reduce the size of the yang
  schema, for example to include just the needed yang modules for a certain
  use-case in a NED package. This can have the benefit of only handling the data
  needed, even avoiding out-of-band changes where the scope is limited but there
  are other parties updating the device. In yet other situations, it might be
  necessary to filter out parts of the schema due to device internal overlaps.


## 11.1 Filtering schema at run-time or compile-time
---------------------------------------------------

  While static filtering can be achieved through simply doing a module which
  marks certain parts of the schema as 'not-supported' with deviations and
  recompile, this can quickly become unpractical.

  The NED contains a filtering feature which can be used both at run-time, as
  well as generating deviations for applying at compile-time. There are some
  built-in rpcs to handle the filters, these are:

  ```
      list-filter-paths
      clear-filter-paths
      import-filter-paths
      add-filter-path
      remove-filter-path
  ```

  The filtering described here only works on schema level (i.e. no key-paths are
  allowed). To filter on 'key-path level', see the ned-setting
  transaction/inject-meta-data and the section 8, 'Custom XML transforms' for
  details on how this can be achieved.

  Since these filters are handled and applied at run-time in the NED, there is
  no need to re-compile the NED for trying them out, hence it simplifies an
  iterative approach to fine-tuning the filters.

  The filters can be both including and excluding certain schema-paths. Note
  that if one adds include filters, only schema-paths included by these are used
  by the NED. So a combination of include and exclude filters can narrow down
  the available schema quite a lot.

  Once the filters are finalized, they can be exported to a file to be applied
  through the ned-setting 'transaction/filter-paths-file', i.e. to be able to be
  shared among several instances of the NED, on ned-settings global or profile
  level.

  In the rpc 'list-filter-paths' there is a useful option 'deviation-module'
  which can export the exclude filters as a single yang module containing
  deviations marking the excluded parts of the schema as 'not-supported', hence
  usable for doing static compile-time filtering. Note, only the exclude filters
  are currently taken into account when generating the deviation-module
  (i.e. include filters are ignored, this might be enhanced in a future
  version). See the next section for an example on how to export a
  deviation-module from the exclude filters.

  When the make variable AUTOPATCH_YANG_NED has the value 'yes' (which it has by
  default), the parts marked as 'not-supported' with deviations will
  automatically be pruned from 'when', 'must', and 'leafref path' yang
  expressions in the rest of the modules. This means that applying
  'not-supported' deviations becomes more of a manageble task. This might
  otherwise be quite cumbersome to try to achieve, depending on existing
  references into parts of the schema marked as 'not-supported'.


## 11.2 Handling overlapping yang modules
----------------------------------------

  Device modules might contain data that partly overlaps, for example when there
  are both some native representation along with some standard modules
  (e.g. openconfig). This results in what we can call 'aliasing', i.e. the same
  data appears in more than one place in the available yang modules. The NED has
  some features for discovering and handling this kind of "mixed" module
  environment.

  As an example, if one creates a package containing all modules available on a
  Cisco IOSXR router. It has three different yang schemas, largely overlapping
  each other. The schemas are: UM (unified model), native, and openconfig.

  To help discover the overlaps, there is a ned-setting called "transaction
  abort-on-diff", which when enabled will prevent overlapping edits which would
  cause NSO to be out-of-sync since the device will represent the same data in
  multiple schemas. As an example, we try to edit the hostname using the UM
  schema:

  ```
  admin@ncs(config)# devices device xrv9k-781 ned-settings cisco-iosxr_nc transaction abort-on-diff true
  admin@ncs(config-device-xrv9k-781)# commit
  Commit complete.
  admin@ncs(config-device-xrv9k-781)# config
  admin@ncs(config-config)# hostname system-network-name foobar
  admin@ncs(config-config)# commit
  Aborted: External error in the NED implementation for device xrv9k-781: Prepare error: Detected diff after apply:
  config {
      oc-sys:system {
          config {
  -           hostname xrv9000;
  +           hostname foobar;
          }
      }
      shellutil-cfg:host-names {
  -       host-name xrv9000;
  +       host-name foobar;
      }
  }
  ```

  As can be seen the NED aborts, telling what diff would result if the config was
  applied to device (i.e. since the hostname also appears in the native and
  openconfig schemas). It does this by sending the edit-config to the device as
  normal. But after this, it immediately does a get-config (from the store in use,
  i.e. 'running' or 'candidate'). With this data, it does a NED-internal
  compare-config (i.e. it compare the to-transaction contents in CDB to what the
  device actually now have). If there is a diff, as in the above example, it
  discards the changes on the device, displaying the abort message to the user.

  With this ned-setting enabled, the edits in a particular use-case can be walked
  through to discover the overlaps.

  To simplify the handling of overlaps even more, There is another ned-setting
  "transaction filter-side-effects", which instead of only aborting, creates
  filters for automatically excluding side-effects. It also takes into account
  what is already in CDB.

  With the above example, if you have already synced in data from
  native/openconfig, but try to commit overlapping data to config in the UM
  schema, then filtering out native and/or openconfig would result in diff
  (i.e. CDB data found, but it will be filtered from device):

  ```
  admin@ncs(config-config)# top no devices device xrv9k-781 ned-settings cisco-iosxr_nc transaction abort-on-diff
  admin@ncs(config-config)# top devices device xrv9k-781 ned-settings cisco-iosxr_nc transaction filter-side-effects true
  admin@ncs(config-config)# abort
  admin@ncs# config
  Entering configuration mode terminal
  admin@ncs(config)# devices device xrv9k-781 config
  admin@ncs(config-config)# hostname system-network-name foobar
  admin@ncs(config-config)# commit
  Aborted: External error in the NED implementation for device xrv9k-781: Prepare error: Detected diff after apply:
  config {
      oc-sys:system {
          config {
  -           hostname xrv9000;
  +           hostname foobar;
          }
      }
      shellutil-cfg:host-names {
  -       host-name xrv9000;
  +       host-name foobar;
      }
  }

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  NOTE: Overlapping edit, the resulting filters would cause the below diff:
  config {
      oc-sys:system {
          config {
  -           hostname xrv9000;
  +           hostname foobar;
          }
      }
      shellutil-cfg:host-names {
  -       host-name xrv9000;
  +       host-name foobar;
      }
  }

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The following filters are overlapping existing data (i.e. causing out-of-sync):
    /oc-sys:system/config/hostname
    /shellutil-cfg:host-names/host-name

  ```

  So in this case, one can't apply the filter "automatically", the suggested
  filters needs to be applied first, then do a sync-from. Like this:

  ```
  admin@ncs(config)# devices device xrv9k-781 rpc rpc-add-filter-path add-filter-path exclude path /oc-sys:system/config/hostname
  result OK
  admin@ncs(config)# devices device xrv9k-781 rpc rpc-add-filter-path add-filter-path exclude path /shellutil-cfg:host-names/host-name
  result OK
  admin@ncs(config)# top devices device xrv9k-781 sync-from
  result true
  admin@ncs(config)# show full-configuration devices device xrv9k-781 config oc-sys:system config
  devices device xrv9k-781
   config
    system config domain-name lab.local
   !
  !
  ```

  As can be seen, the NED is now filtering out the hostname from the openconfig
  schema.

  So now if we try to edit the hostname through the UM schema, it will succeed.

  ```
  admin@ncs(config-config)# hostname system-network-name foobar
  admin@ncs(config-config)# commit
  Commit complete.
  admin@ncs(config-config)# top devices device xrv9k-781 compare-config
  admin@ncs(config-config)#
  ```

  Lets take another example, where there is no overlapping data stored in CDB,
  then the filters can be generated and applied automatically:

  ```
  admin@ncs(config)# devices device xrv9k-781 config um-interface-cfg:interfaces interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0
  admin@ncs(config-interface-GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0)# mtu 4096
  admin@ncs(config-interface-GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0)# commit
  Commit complete.
  admin@ncs(config-interface-GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0)# top devices device xrv9k-781 compare-config
  ```

  There is no overlap, the commit was successful, and the filters that was
  generated from this commit have been added automatically.

  ```
  admin@ncs(config-interface-GigabitEthernet0/0/0/0)# top devices device xrv9k-781 rpc rpc-list-filter-paths list-filter-paths | inc mtu
  result
  exclude /ifmgr-cfg:interface-configurations/interface-configuration/mtus/mtu
  exclude /oc-if:interfaces/interface/config/mtu

  ```

  And now the resulting deviations, from both our manually added filter for the
  hostname and the automcatically generated filter from the edit of the mtu:

  ```
  admin@ncs(config-config)# top devices device xrv9k-781 rpc rpc-list-filter-paths list-filter-paths deviation-module
  result
  module nedcom-auto-deviations {
    namespace urn:tail-f.com:nedcom-auto-deviations;
    prefix nedcom-auto-deviations;
    import Cisco-IOS-XR-ifmgr-cfg {
      prefix ifmgr-cfg;
    }
    import Cisco-IOS-XR-shellutil-cfg {
      prefix shellutil-cfg;
    }
    import openconfig-system {
      prefix oc-sys;
    }
    import openconfig-interfaces {
      prefix oc-if;
    }
    revision 2023-03-27 {
      description "Automatic deviations generated from exclude filter";
    }
    deviation /ifmgr-cfg:interface-configurations/ifmgr-cfg:interface-configuration/ifmgr-cfg:mtus/ifmgr-cfg:mtu {
      deviate not-supported;
    }
    deviation /oc-if:interfaces/oc-if:interface/oc-if:config/oc-if:mtu {
      deviate not-supported;
    }
    deviation /oc-sys:system/oc-sys:config/oc-sys:hostname {
      deviate not-supported;
    }
    deviation /shellutil-cfg:host-names/shellutil-cfg:host-name {
      deviate not-supported;
    }
  }
  ```

# 12. Custom XML transforms
---------------------------

  One useful feature present in the NED package is the ability to have java code
  manipulate the contents of netconf XML before sent to NSO, or when applying
  edits, before being sent to the device. This feature is implemented as custom
  XML transform methods which can be referred in the yang schema, either
  statically at compile time, or dynamically at run-time. In the case of
  run-time referral, it can even be done on a per key-path level,
  i.e. transforms can be called for specific key-paths in data.

  While the implementation of these transforms is out of scope for this document
  and for normal usage of the NED, the application of built-in transforms is a
  very powerful additional tool which can be used to overcome some issues
  commonly found in various devices.

  To refer the transforms from yang, the custom tailf extension meta-data is
  used. Since editing the original yang is discouraged, the meta-data extension
  can be either added at compile-time through the schema customization mechanism
  described in section 4 in the README-rebuild.md, or at run-time through the
  ned-setting 'transaction inject-meta-data' (which can take key-paths).

  The built-in transforms that can be referred are listed below. Note that each
  transform is declared to work under certain constraints, regarding 'direction'
  (i.e. to or from device), what type of yang node it can operate on, and so on.


## 12.1 filter-exclude-config
-----------------------------

  This transform filters out config, by default in both directions, i.e. it will
  act the same as if an exclude filter-path is added at the given node in the
  schema. It can be applied on all types of nodes, for container and list nodes,
  all children will also be filtered out. If a meta-value argument with either
  value 'from-device' or 'to-device' is added, the filtering will only occur in
  the given direction (NOTE: this means that NSO and the device might get
  out-of-sync, use with care).

  Since meta-data can be injected on key-path level, it's even possible to
  filter out a certain instance from a list in the configuration such as this:

    transaction inject-meta-data 1 path /ni:network-instance/ni:instances/ni:instance{_public_}/mpls:mpls/mpls:common meta-data filter-exclude-config


## 12.2 filter-by-version
-------------------------

  This transform acts similarly to 'filter-exclude-config', however, it always
  applies in both directions. It takes a mandatory meta-value whose format is
  described below. It is used together with the ned-setting
  transaction/filter-config-by-version which provides a version used for
  comparison, or when that ned-setting has the value 'auto', a device version
  which is supplied through a ned-specific implementation calling the method
  setDeviceVersion().

  The meta-value describes a range for the version to compare to, and if valid,
  will let the config pass, i.e. filtering out config for which the meta-value
  is false. The format of the meta-value is best described using an example
  value:

      The following meta-value:

      1.0 < VERSION <= 2.0

      Means to include config marked with filter-by-version, only if the version
      provided through the transaction/filter-config-by-version ned-setting is
      greater than 1.0 and less than or equal to 2.0. To clarify, at run-time,
      the token VERSION in the meta-value is substituted with the version
      provided by the ned-setting (or the NED) and then the expression is
      evaluated. The upper or lower bound of the range can be left out to make
      it 'open' in one end, like this:

      VERSION <= 2.0

      1.0 < VERSION

  NOTE: The version format can also be three digits, e.g. 7.3.1. The version can
  contain one, two or three digits, which can be freely mixed in expressions.


## 12.3 filter-leaf
-------------------

  This transform can filter out leaf values which are either invalid, or has the
  default value declared in the yang module. It works as a combination of the
  ned-settings transaction/filter-invalid-values=true and the
  capabilities/defaults-mode-override=trim but only for the leaf node where this
  meta-data is applied. The mandatory meta-value can be either of:

      filter-invalid              Will filter invalid values
      trim-default                Will filter default values
      filter-invalid,trim-default Will filter both invalid and default values


## 12.4 reorder-keys
--------------------

  This transform can be used where a device gives data in a non-compliant format
  where list keys are either out-of-order or not the first elements in the XML,
  i.e. where the XML needs to be re-ordered before being validated against the
  yang schema. It takes no meta-value and should be placed on the problematic
  list node(s) in the schema.


## 12.5 edit-full-delete
------------------------

  This transform can be used when a device acts in a non-compliant way, where a
  container needs to be deleted instead of its contents. It can be needed where
  a device doesn't want a reachable default value set back instead of it being
  deleted, which is how NSO normally 'clears' a value which is to be deleted,
  and which has a default value declared.


## 12.6 edit-op
---------------

  This transform can be used to set the netconf operation to use when the node
  in question is to be deleted or edited. By default nodes are deleted with the
  operation 'delete'. With this transform, one can instead use 'remove' (or any
  proprietary keyword) to do the delete instead. It can also be used to reverse
  the effect of the ned-setting transaction/delete-with-remove is enabled,
  i.e. to force 'delete' for selected node(s), for a given node. Also, the
  edit-op can be set to 'replace' (or any proprietary keyword) to force that
  netconf operation whenever the node is present in edit-config (i.e. if not
  deleted).


## 12.7 hidden-config
---------------------

  This transform can be used if device contains config that can be set, but
  which is not reflected in the running configuration. It can be used on leaf
  and leaf-list nodes. When the annotated node is set from NSO, it is always
  echoed back from the NED to NSO as if the device contains the value. It works
  like the annotation tailf:ned-ignore-compare-config, but can also be used on
  leaf-list nodes. The only difference is that from NSO perspective the data
  looks as if it is actually present on device.


## 12.8 redeploy-on-edit
------------------------

  With this transform added on a node in the schema, the node and its children
  will be redeployed in full when edited (i.e. as if the whole content doesn't
  exist on device). This means that if the node is present in the edit-config,
  its contents in the edit-config will be replaced with the full content in the
  to-transaction. This is useful if the device has the non-compliant behaviour
  as if 'replace' is implied on the node, i.e. the device resets all the node's
  content to only include the contents in the edit-config, which results in NSO
  becoming out-of-sync if not all contents are redeployed in the edit.


## 12.9 remove-before-edit
--------------------------

  This transform will inject a delete of the annotated node when it appears in
  an edit-config. This can be useful if the device has the non-compliant
  behaviour that the contents of a node can not be edited if not first cleared
  in the same edit.

  This annotataion can also take the meta-value argument 'delayed-commit', see
  'redeploy-point' for more info on this.

## 12.10 redeploy-parent-on-edit + redeploy-point
-------------------------------------------------

  The transform 'redeploy-parent-on-edit' will redeploy the parent annotated with 'redeploy-point', whenever this node is edited. The parent will also first be deleted.
  an edit-config. This can be useful if the device has the non-compliant
  behaviour that the contents of a node can not be edited if not first cleared
  in the same edit.

  For example, if a device can't edit the pw-id and peer-ip inside the pw list
  within an l2vpn instance, but instead actually needs the full instance to be
  deleted and redeployed in the same edit, the below injects could be used in
  customize-schmea.schypp:

    add /l2vpn/instances/instance::tailf:meta-data redeploy-point;
    add /l2vpn/instances/instance/vpws-ldp/pws/pw/pw-id::tailf:meta-data redeploy-parent-on-edit;
    add /l2vpn/instances/instance/vpws-ldp/pws/pw/peer-ip::tailf:meta-data redeploy-parent-on-edit;

  The meta-value argument 'delayed-commit' can be used in 'redeploy-point' (and
  in 'remove-before-edit' as mentioned above) to force a split of the
  edit-config, so that the delete will happen in first edit-config sent
  (together with the rest of the edit), after which a commit is sent. Then there
  will be an additional edit-config/commit containing the new config to be
  set. This can work in some use-cases, however, since this behaviour indicates
  a serious deviation from standard netconf transactionality in the device, it
  must be used with great care, and is not guarateed to work.

  NOTE: If using 'delayed-commit', the ned-setting 'transaction
  force-revert-diff' must be enabled to ensure that config is rolled back
  correctly to compensate for the intermediate commit done.


## 12.11 replace-all-leaf-list|long-obu-diff-leaf-list
------------------------------------------------------

  In some devices it has been observed that leaf-list nodes doesn't behave
  according to netconf standard. Two annotations exists which can be used to
  mitigate two problems found.

  The first is 'replace-all-leaf-list' which indicates that the semantics of the
  leaf-list is that all its content must re-added when edited, i.e. members not
  present in edit-config are reset on device (which causes NSO to be
  out-of-sync). Hence, editing the leaf-list always includes all members present
  after the transaction (i.e. no explicit delete operation is needed). This can
  potentially result in a very large edit-config of course, if the leaf-list has
  many members.

  The other annotation, 'long-obu-diff-leaf-list' can be used when the leaf-list
  has the semantics of an 'ordered-by user' leaf-list, but is not editable as
  such (i.e. the normal netconf move can not be used). Instead, it will be
  edited by adding/deleteing members, hence the resulting edit for a re-order
  will first remove all elements from the first inserted element, then the rest
  of the elements will be added in correct order, as if being added for the
  first time. As with 'replace-all-leaf-list', this can potentially also result
  in a very large edit-config.


## 12.12 diff-set|delete-before|after
-------------------------------------

  Some devices have non-compliant behaviour such that in certain use-cases, the
  order of the contents in edit-config matters. In these cases this might be
  solved by adding re-ordering meta-data annotations. These annotations are then
  used to force a re-order when specific nodes appears in the edit-config.

  NOTE: To be able to use these annotations, the ned-setting
  'transaction enable-diff-dependencies' must be set to true.

  The annotation is added to the node to be re-ordered, relative to another
  (target) node, when both are present. The path to the target node is given by
  appending ':<path-to-target>' to the chosen re-order variant.

    The four annotation variants available are:

    diff-set-before:<path-to-target>
    diff-set-after:<path-to-target>
    diff-delete-before:<path-to-target>
    diff-delete-after:<path-to-target>

  For example if the schema has a node 'scheduler' which needs to be set before
  it's sibling queue-group, present in schema in parent node
  /mef-egress-qos:egress-qos, the below annotation injection can be used in the
  customize-schema.schypp file to achive the needed re-ordering:

    add /mef-egress-qos:egress-qos/scheduler::tailf:meta-data "diff-set-before:../queue-group";

  This will have the effect that whenever both scheduler and queue-group are
  present in an edit-config, scheduler will be set before queue-group.


# 13. Run arbitrary commands on device
--------------------------------------

  Some commands that are available to a user logged in to an interactive CLI
  session on the device might not be available through NETCONF. For situations
  like this the NED provides the feature to run arbitrary commands through an
  interactive SSH login to the device. This SSH session is handled internally in
  the NED and connected in NSO to a live-status action called 'exec any'.

  There are some ned-settings to control the behaviour of this feature, see the
  section 'ned-settings juniper-junos_nc live-status cli' in
  README-ned-settings.md for details on this.

  Specifically, to be able to handle the interactive session towards the device,
  the NED needs to know the format for the device prompt. It also assumes that
  pagination is turned off before reading output from command sent (i.e. that
  the device doesn't pause terminal output, waiting for interactive
  response). The ned-settings 'prompt-pattern' and 'no-pagniation-cmd' are used
  to control this. These might have proper default values, please check that
  this matches your device though before trying this feature, since if not
  configured correctly the NED will hang until timed out.

  As an example, to run the command 'show running-config' on the device, and get
  the resulting output as a string from the ncs_cli, run the following:

  ```
  admin@ncs# devices device dev-1 live-status exec any show running-config
  ```

  Note that when using ncs_cli, the command-line given might need to be quoted
  if it contains characters that are interpreted by the ncs_cli itself.

# 14. Migrating from juniper-junos to the juniper-junos_nc generic NED
----------------------------------------------------------------------

NSO has supported Junos devices from early on. The legacy juniper-junos NED is NETCONF-based, but as Junos devices did not provide YANG modules in the past, complex NSO machinery translated Juniper's XML Schema Description (XSD) files into a single YANG module. This was an attempt to aggregate several Juniper device modules/versions.

Juniper nowadays provides YANG modules for Junos devices. Junos YANG modules can be downloaded from the device and used directly in NSO with the new juniper-junos_nc generic NED.

By downloading the YANG modules using juniper-junos_nc NED tools and rebuilding the NED, the NED can provide full coverage immediately when the device is updated instead of waiting for a new legacy NED release.

The guide in below link describes how to replace the legacy juniper-junos NED and migrate NSO applications to the juniper-junos_nc generic NED.
