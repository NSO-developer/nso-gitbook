## `confd_lib`

`confd_lib` - C library for connecting to NSO

### Library

NSO Library, (`libconfd`, `-lconfd`)

### Description

The `libconfd` shared library is used to connect to NSO. The
documentation for the library is divided into several manual pages:

[confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib)  
> Common Library Functions

[confd_lib_dp(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_dp)  
> The Data Provider API

[confd_lib_events(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_events)  
> The Event Notification API

[confd_lib_ha(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_ha)  
> The High Availability API

[confd_lib_cdb(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_cdb)  
> The CDB API

[confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi)  
> The Management Agent API

There is also a C header file associated with each of these manual
pages:

`#include <confd_lib.h>`  
> Common type definitions and prototypes for the functions in the
> [confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib) manual page. Always needed.

`#include <confd_dp.h>`  
> Needed when functions in the [confd_lib_dp(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_dp)
> manual page are used.

`#include <confd_events.h>`  
> Needed when functions in the
> [confd_lib_events(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_events) manual page are used.

`#include <confd_ha.h>`  
> Needed when functions in the [confd_lib_ha(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_ha)
> manual page are used.

`#include <confd_cdb.h>`  
> Needed when functions in the [confd_lib_cdb(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_cdb)
> manual page are used.

`#include <confd_maapi.h>`  
> Needed when functions in the
> [confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi) manual page are used.

For backwards compatibility, `#include <confd.h>` can also be used, and
is equivalent to:

<div class="informalexample">

    #include <confd_lib.h>
    #include <confd_dp.h>
    #include <confd_events.h>
    #include <confd_ha.h>

</div>

### Library

NSO Library, (`libconfd`, `-lconfd`)

### Description

The `libconfd` shared library is used to connect to the NSO built-in XML
database, CDB. The purpose of this API is to provide a read and
subscription API to CDB.

CDB owns and stores the configuration data and the user of the API wants
to read that configuration data and also get notified when someone
through either NETCONF, SNMP, the CLI, the Web UI or the MAAPI modifies
the data so that the application can re-read the configuration data and
act accordingly.

CDB can also store operational data, i.e. data which is designated with
a `"config false"` statement in the YANG data model. Operational data
can be both read and written by the applications, but NETCONF and the
other northbound agents can only read the operational data.

### Paths

The majority of the functions described here take as their two last
arguments a format string and a variable number of extra arguments as
in: `char *``fmt`, `...``);`

The `fmt` is a printf style format string which is used to format a path
into the XML data tree. Assume the following YANG fragment:

<div class="informalexample">

    container hosts {
      list host {
        key name;
        leaf name {
          type string;
        }
        leaf domain {
          type string;
        }
        leaf defgw {
          type inet:ipv4-address;
        }
        container interfaces {
          list interface {
            key name;
            leaf name {
              type string;
            }
            leaf ip {
              type inet:ipv4-address;
            }
            leaf mask {
              type inet:ipv4-address;
            }
            leaf enabled {
              type boolean;
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

</div>

Furthermore, assuming our database is populated with the following data.

<div class="informalexample">

    <hosts xmlns="http://example.com/ns/hst/1.0">
      <host>
        <name>buzz</name>
        <domain>tail-f.com</domain>
        <defgw>192.168.1.1</defgw>
        <interfaces>
          <interface>
            <name>eth0</name>
            <ip>192.168.1.61</ip>
            <mask>255.255.255.0</mask>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
          </interface>
          <interface>
            <name>eth1</name>
            <ip>10.77.1.44</ip>
            <mask>255.255.0.0</mask>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
          </interface>
        </interfaces>
      </host>
    </hosts>

</div>

The format path /hosts/host{buzz}/defgw refers to the leaf called defgw
of the host whose key (name leaf) is `buzz`.

The format path /hosts/host{buzz}/interfaces/interface{eth0}/ip refers
to the leaf called ip in the `eth0` interface of the host called `buzz`.

It is possible loop through all entries in a list as in:

<div class="informalexample">

    n = cdb_num_instances(sock, "/hosts/host");
    for (i=0; i<n; i++) {
        cdb_cd(sock, "/hosts/host[%d]", i)
        .....

</div>

Thus instead of an actually instantiated key inside a pair of curly
braces {key}, we can use a temporary integer key inside a pair of
brackets `[n]`.

We can use the following modifiers:

%d  
> requiring an integer parameter (type `int`) to be substituted.

%u  
> requiring an unsigned integer parameter (type `unsigned int`) to be
> substituted.

%s  
> requiring a `char*` string parameter to be substituted.

%ip4  
> requiring a `struct in_addr*` to be substituted.

%ip6  
> requiring a `struct in6_addr*` to be substituted.

%x  
> requiring a `confd_value_t*` to be substituted.

%\*x  
> requiring an array length and a `confd_value_t*` pointing to an array
> of values to be substituted.

%h  
> requiring a `confd_hkeypath_t*` to be substituted.

%\*h  
> requiring a length and a `confd_hkeypath_t*` to be substituted.

Thus,

<div class="informalexample">

    char *hname = "earth";
    struct in_addr ip;
    ip.s_addr = inet_addr("127.0.0.1");

    cdb_cd(sock, "/hosts/host{%s}/bar{%ip4}", hname, &ip);

</div>

would change the current position to the path:
"/hosts/host{earth}/bar{127.0.0.1}"

It is also possible to use the different '%' modifiers outside the curly
braces, thus the above example could have been written as:

<div class="informalexample">

    char *prefix = "/hosts/host";
    cdb_cd(sock, "%s{%s}/bar{%ip4}", prefix, hname, &ip);

</div>

If an element has multiple keys, the keys must be space separated as in
`cdb_cd("/bars/bar{%s %d}/item", str, i);`. However the '%\*x' modifier
is an exception to this rule, and it is especially useful when we have a
number of key values that are unknown at compile time. If we have a list
foo which is known to have two keys, and we have those keys in an array
`key[]`, we can use `cdb_cd("/foo{%x %x}", &key[0], &key[1]);.` But if
the number of keys is unknown at compile time (or if we just want a more
compact code), we can instead use `cdb_cd("/foo{%*x}", n, key);` where
`n` is the number of keys.

The '%h' and '%\*h' modifiers can only be used at the beginning of a
format path, as they expand to the absolute path corresponding to the
`confd_hkeypath_t`. These modifiers are particularly useful with
`cdb_diff_iterate()` (see below), or for MAAPI access in data provider
callbacks (see [confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi) and
[confd_lib_dp(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_dp)). The '%\*h' variant allows for
using only the initial part of a `confd_hkeypath_t`, as specified by the
preceding length argument (similar to '%.\*s' for `printf(3)`).

For example, if the `iter()` function passed to `cdb_diff_iterate()` has
been invoked with a `confd_hkeypath_t *kp` that corresponds to
/hosts/host{buzz}, we can read the defgw child element with

<div class="informalexample">

    confd_value_t v;
    cdb_get(s, &v, "%h/defgw", kp);

</div>

or the entire list entry with

<div class="informalexample">

    confd_value_t v[5];
    cdb_get_object(sock, v, 5, "%h", kp);

</div>

or the defgw child element for host `mars` with

<div class="informalexample">

    confd_value_t v;
    cdb_get(s, &v, "%*h{mars}/defgw", kp->len - 1, kp);

</div>

All the functions that take a path on this form also have a `va_list`
variant, of the same form as `cdb_vget()` and `cdb_vset_elem()`, which
are the only ones explicitly documented below. I.e. they have a prefix
"cdb_v" instead of "cdb\_", and take a single va_list argument instead
of a variable number of arguments.

### Functions

All functions return CONFD_OK (0), CONFD_ERR (-1) or CONFD_EOF (-2)
unless otherwise stated. CONFD_EOF means that the socket to NSO has been
closed.

Whenever CONFD_ERR is returned from any API function described here, it
is possible to obtain additional information on the error through the
symbol `confd_errno`, see the [ERRORS](section3.md#confd_lib_lib.errors)
section in the [confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib) manual page.

    int cdb_connect(
    int sock, enum cdb_sock_type type, const struct sockaddr *srv, int srv_sz);

The application has to connect to NSO before it can interact. There are
two different types of connections identified by `cdb_sock_type`:

`CDB_DATA_SOCKET`  
> This is a socket which is used to read configuration data, or to read
> and write operational data.

`CDB_SUBSCRIPTION_SOCKET`  
> This is a socket which is used to receive notifications about updates
> to the database. A subscription socket needs to be part of the
> application poll set.

Additionally the type CDB_READ_SOCKET is accepted for backwards
compatibility - it is equivalent to CDB_DATA_SOCKET.

A call to `cdb_connect()` is typically followed by a call to either
`cdb_start_session()` for a reading session or a call to
`cdb_subscribe()` for a subscription socket.

> **Note**  
>  
> If this call fails (i.e. does not return CONFD_OK), the socket
> descriptor must be closed and a new socket created before the call is
> re-attempted.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

    int cdb_connect_name(
    int sock, enum cdb_sock_type type, const struct sockaddr *srv, int srv_sz, 
    const char *name);

When we use `cdb_connect()` to create a connection to NSO/CDB, the
`name` parameter passed to the library initialization function
`confd_init()` (see [confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib)) is used to
identify the connection in status reports and logs. If we want different
names to be used for different connections from the same application
process, we can use `cdb_connect_name()` with the wanted name instead of
`cdb_connect()`.

> **Note**  
>  
> If this call fails (i.e. does not return CONFD_OK), the socket
> descriptor must be closed and a new socket created before the call is
> re-attempted.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

    int cdb_mandatory_subscriber(
    int sock, const char *name);

Attaches a mandatory attribute and a mandatory name to the subscriber
identified by `sock`. The `name` parameter is distinct from the name
parameter in `cdb_connect_name`.

CDB keeps a list of mandatory subscribers for infinite extent, i.e.
until confd is restarted. The function is idempotent.

Absence of one or more mandatory subscribers will result in abort of all
transactions. A mandatory subscriber must be present during the entire
PREPARE delivery phase.

If a mandatory subscriber crashes during a PREPARE delivery phase, the
subscriber should be restarted and the commit operation should be
retried.

A mandatory subscriber is present if the subscriber has issued at least
one `cdb_subscribe2()` call followed by a `cdb_subscribe_done()` call.

A call to `cdb_mandatory_subscriber()` is only allowed before the first
call of `cdb_subscribe2()`.

> **Note**  
>

    int cdb_set_namespace(
    int sock, int hashed_ns);

If we want to access data in CDB where the toplevel element name is not
unique, we need to set the namespace. We are reading data related to a
specific .fxs file. confdc can be used to generate a `.h` file with a
\#define for the namespace, by the flag `--emit-h` to confdc (see
[confdc(1)](section1.md#confdc)).

It is also possible to indicate which namespace to use through the
namespace prefix when we read and write data. Thus the path /foo:bar/baz
will get us /bar/baz in the namespace with prefix "foo" regardless of
what the "set" namespace is. And if there is only one toplevel element
called "bar" across all namespaces, we can use /bar/baz without the
prefix and without calling `cdb_set_namespace()`.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int cdb_end_session(
    int sock);

We use `cdb_connect()` to establish a read socket to CDB. When the
socket is closed, the read session is ended. We can reuse the same
socket for another read session, but we must then end the session and
create another session using `cdb_start_session()`.

While we have a live CDB read session for configuration data, CDB is
normally locked for writing. Thus all external entities trying to modify
CDB are blocked as long as we have an open CDB read session. It is very
important that we remember to either `cdb_end_session()` or
`cdb_close()` once we have read what we wish to read.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int cdb_start_session(
    int sock, enum cdb_db_type db);

Starts a new session on an already established socket to CDB. The db
parameter should be one of:

`CDB_RUNNING`  
> Creates a read session towards the running database.

`CDB_PRE_COMMIT_RUNNING`  
> Creates a read session towards the running database as it was before
> the current transaction was committed. This is only possible between a

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_LOCKED,
CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

If the error is CONFD_ERR_LOCKED it means that we are trying to create a
new CDB read session precisely when the write phase of some transaction
is occurring. Thus correct usage of `cdb_start_session()` is:

<div class="informalexample">

     while (1) {
       if (cdb_start_session(sock, CDB_RUNNING) == CONFD_OK)
          break;
       if (confd_errno == CONFD_ERR_LOCKED) {
          sleep(1);
          continue;
       }
       .... handle error
    }

</div>

Alternatively we can use `cdb_start_session2()` with `flags` =
CDB_LOCK_SESSION\|CDB_LOCK_WAIT. This means that the call will block
until the lock has been acquired, and thus we do not need the retry
loop.

    int cdb_start_session2(
    int sock, enum cdb_db_type db, int flags);

This function may be used instead of `cdb_start_session()` if it is
considered necessary to have more detailed control over some aspects of
the CDB session - if in doubt, use `cdb_start_session()` instead. The
`sock` and `db` arguments are the same as for `cdb_start_session()`, and
these values can be used for `flags` (ORed together if more than one):

<div class="informalexample">

    #define CDB_LOCK_WAIT     (1 << 0)
    #define CDB_LOCK_SESSION  (1 << 1)
    #define CDB_LOCK_REQUEST  (1 << 2)
    #define CDB_LOCK_PARTIAL  (1 << 3)

</div>

The flags affect sessions for the different database types as follows:

`CDB_RUNNING`  
> CDB_LOCK_SESSION obtains a read lock for the complete session, i.e.
> using this flag alone is equivalent to calling `cdb_start_session()`.
> CDB_LOCK_REQUEST obtains a read lock only for the duration of each
> read request. This means that values of elements read in different
> requests may be inconsistent with each other, and the consequences of
> this must be carefully considered. In particular, the use of
> `cdb_num_instances()` and the `[n]` "integer index" notation in
> keypaths is inherently unsafe in this mode. Note: The implementation
> will not actually obtain a lock for a single-value request, since that
> is an atomic operation anyway. The CDB_LOCK_PARTIAL flag is not
> allowed.

`CDB_STARTUP`  
> Same as CDB_RUNNING.

`CDB_PRE_COMMIT_RUNNING`  
> This database type does not have any locks, which means that it is an
> error to call `cdb_start_session2()` with any CDB_LOCK_XXX flag
> included in `flags`. Using a `flags` value of 0 is equivalent to
> calling `cdb_start_session()`.

`CDB_OPERATIONAL`  
> CDB_LOCK_REQUEST obtains a "subscription lock" for the duration of
> each write request. This can be described as an "advisory exclusive"
> lock, i.e. only one client at a time can hold the lock (unless

In all cases of using CDB_LOCK_SESSION or CDB_LOCK_REQUEST described
above, adding the CDB_LOCK_WAIT flag means that instead of failing with
CONFD_ERR_LOCKED if the lock can not be obtained immediately, requests
will wait for the lock to become available. When used with
CDB_LOCK_SESSION it pertains to `cdb_start_session2()` itself, with
CDB_LOCK_REQUEST it pertains to the individual requests.

While it is possible to use this function to start a session towards a
configuration database type with no locking at all (`flags` = 0), this
is strongly discouraged in general, since it means that even the values
read in a single multi-value request (e.g. `cdb_get_object()`, see
below) may be inconsistent with each other. However it is necessary to
do this if we want to have a session open during semantic validation,
see the "Semantic Validation" chapter in the User Guide - and in this
particular case it is safe, since the transaction lock prevents changes
to CDB during validation.

Reading operational data from CDB while there is an ongoing transaction,
CDB will by default read through the transaction, returning the value
from the transaction if it is being modified. By giving the
CDB_READ_COMMITTED flag this behaviour can be overridden in the
operational datastore, such that the value already committed to the
datastore is read.

    int cdb_close(
    int sock);

Closes the socket. `cdb_end_session()` should be called before calling
this function.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

Even if the call returns an error, the socket will be closed.

    int cdb_wait_start(
    int sock);

This call waits until CDB has completed start-phase 1 and is available,
when it is CONFD_OK is returned. If CDB already is available (i.e.
start-phase \>= 1) the call returns immediately. This can be used by a
CDB client who is not synchronously started and only wants to wait until
it can read its configuration. The call can be used after cdb_connect().

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

    int cdb_get_phase(
    int sock, struct cdb_phase *phase);

Returns the start-phase CDB is currently in, in the struct cdb_phase
pointed to by the second argument. Also if CDB is in phase 0 and has
initiated an init transaction (to load any init files) the flag
CDB_FLAG_INIT is set in the flags field of struct cdb_phase and
correspondingly if an upgrade session is started the CDB_FLAG_UPGRADE is
set. The call can be used after cdb_connect() and returns CONFD_OK.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

    int cdb_initiate_journal_compaction(
    int sock);

Normally CDB handles journal compaction of the config datastore
automatically. If this has been turned off (in the configuration file)
then the .cdb files will grow indefinitely unless this API function is
called periodically to initiate compaction. This function initiates a
compaction and returns immediately (if the datastore is unavailable, the
compaction will be delayed, but eventually compaction will take place).
This will also initiate compaction of the operational datastore O.cdb
and snapshot datastore S.cdb but without delay.

*Errors*: -

    int cdb_initiate_journal_dbfile_compaction(
    int sock, enum cdb_dbfile_type dbfile);

Similar to `cdb_initiate_journal_compaction()` but initiates the
compaction on the specified CDB file instead of all CDB files. The
`dbfile` argument is identified by `enum cdb_dbfile_type`. The valid
values for NSO are

`CDB_A_CDB`  
> This is the configuration datastore A.cdb

`CDB_O_CDB`  
> This is the operational datastore O.cdb

`CDB_S_CDB`  
> This is the snapshot datastore S.cdb

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_PROTOUSAGE

    int cdb_get_compaction_info(
    int sock, enum cdb_dbfile_type dbfile, struct cdb_compaction_info *info);

Returns the compaction information for the specified CDB file pointed to
by the `dbfile` argument, see `cdb_initiate_journal_dbfile_compaction()`
for further information. The result is stored in the `info` argument of
`struct cdb_compaction_info`, containing the current file size, file
size of the dbfile after the last compaction, the number of transactions
since last compaction, as well as the timestamp of the last compaction.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_PROTOUSAGE, CONFD_ERR_UNAVAILABLE

    int cdb_get_txid(
    int sock, struct cdb_txid *txid);

Read the last transaction id from CDB. This function can be used if we
are forced to reconnect to CDB, If the transaction id we read is
identical to the last id we had prior to loosing the CDB sockets we
don't have to reload our managed object data. See the User Guide for
full explanation. Returns CONFD_OK on success and CONFD_ERR or CONFD_EOF
on failure.

    int cdb_get_replay_txids(
    int sock, struct cdb_txid **txid, int *resultlen);

When the subscriptionReplay functionality is enabled in confd.conf this
function returns the list of available transactions that CDB can replay.
The current transaction id will be the first in the list, the second at
txid\[1\] and so on. The number of transactions is returned in
`resultlen`. In case there are no replay transactions available (the
feature isn't enabled or there hasn't been any transactions yet) only
one (the current) transaction id is returned. It is up to the caller to
`free()` `txid` when it is no longer needed.

    int cdb_set_timeout(
    int sock, int timeout_secs);

A timeout for client actions can be specified via
/confdConfig/cdb/clientTimeout in `confd.conf`, see the
[confd.conf(5)](section5.md#ncs.conf) manual page. This function can be used
to dynamically extend (or shorten) the timeout for the current action.
Thus it is possible to configure a restrictive timeout in `confd.conf`,
but still allow specific actions to have a longer execution time.

The function can be called either with a subscription socket during
subscription delivery on that socket (including from the `iter()`
function passed to `cdb_diff_iterate()`), or with a data socket that has
an active session. The timeout is given in seconds from the point in
time when the function is called.

> **Note**  
>  
> The timeout for subscription delivery is common for all the

    int cdb_exists(
    int sock, const char *fmt, ...);

Leafs in the data model may be optional, and presence containers and
list entries may or may not exist. This function checks whether a node
exists in CDB. Returns 0 for false, 1 for true and CONFD_ERR or
CONFD_EOF for errors.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH

    int cdb_cd(
    int sock, const char *fmt, ...);

Changes the working directory according to the format path. Note that
this function can not be used as an existence test.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH

    int cdb_pushd(
    int sock, const char *fmt, ...);

Similar to `cdb_cd()` but pushes the previous current directory on a
stack.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSTACK,
CONFD_ERR_BADPATH

    int cdb_popd(
    int sock);

Pops the top element from the directory stack and changes directory to
previous directory.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSTACK

    int cdb_getcwd(
    int sock, size_t strsz, char *curdir);

Returns the current position as previously set by `cdb_cd()`,
`cdb_pushd()`, or `cdb_popd()` as a string path. Note that what is
returned is a pretty-printed version of the internal representation of
the current position, it will be the shortest unique way to print the
path but it might not exactly match the string given to `cdb_cd()`. The
buffer in \*curdir will be NULL terminated, and no more characters than
strsz-1 will be written to it.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

    int cdb_getcwd_kpath(
    int sock, confd_hkeypath_t **kp);

Returns the current position like `cdb_getcwd()`, but as a pointer to a
hashed keypath instead of as a string. The hkeypath is dynamically
allocated, and may further contain dynamically allocated elements. The
caller must free the allocated memory, easiest done by calling
`confd_free_hkeypath()`.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

    int cdb_num_instances(
    int sock, const char *fmt, ...);

Returns the number of entries in a list or leaf-list. On error CONFD_ERR
or CONFD_EOF is returned.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH,
CONFD_ERR_UNAVAILABLE

    int cdb_next_index(
    int sock, const char *fmt, ...);

Given a path to a list entry `cdb_next_index()` returns the position
(starting from 0) of the next entry (regardless of whether the path
exists or not). When the list has multiple keys a `*` may be used for
the last keys to make the path partially instantiated. For example if
/foo/bar has three integer keys, the following pseudo code could be used
to iterate over all entries with `42` as the first key:

<div class="informalexample">

    /* find the first entry of /foo/bar with 42 as first key */
    ix = cdb_next_index(sock, "/foo/bar{42 * *}");
    for (; ix>=0; ix++) {
        int32_t k1 = 0;
        cdb_get_int32(sock, &k1, "/foo/bar[%d]/key1", ix);
        if (k1 != 42) break;
        /* ... do something with /foo/bar[%d] ... */
    }

</div>

If there is no next entry -1 is returned. It is not possible to use this
function on an ordered-by user list. On error CONFD_ERR or CONFD_EOF is
returned.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH,
CONFD_ERR_UNAVAILABLE

    int cdb_index(
    int sock, const char *fmt, ...);

Given a path to a list entry `cdb_index()` returns its position
(starting from 0). On error CONFD_ERR or CONFD_EOF is returned.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH

    int cdb_is_default(
    int sock, const char *fmt, ...);

This function returns 1 for a leaf which has a default value defined in
the data model when no value has been set, i.e. when the default value
is in effect. It returns 0 for other existing leafs, and CONFD_ERR or
CONFD_EOF for errors. There is normally no need to call this function,
since CDB automatically provides the default value as needed when
cdb_get() etc is called.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH,
CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS, CONFD_ERR_UNAVAILABLE

    int cdb_subscribe(
    int sock, int priority, int nspace, int *spoint, const char *fmt, ...);

Sets up a CDB subscription so that we are notified when CDB
configuration data changes. There can be multiple subscription points
from different sources, that is a single client daemon can have many
subscriptions and there can be many client daemons.

Each subscription point is defined through a path similar to the paths
we use for read operations. We can subscribe either to specific leafs or
entire subtrees. Subscribing to list entries can be done using fully
qualified paths, or tagpaths to match multiple entries. A path which
isn't a leaf element automatically matches the subtree below that path.
When specifying keys to a list entry it is possible to use the wildcard
character \* which will match any key value.

When subscribing to a leaf with a `tailf:default-ref` statement, or to a
subtree with elements that have `tailf:default-ref`, implicit
subscriptions to the referred leafs are added. This means that a change
in a referred leaf will generate a notification for the subscription
that has referring leaf(s) - but currently such a change will not be
reported by `cdb_diff_iterate()`. Thus to get the new "effective" value
of a referring leaf in this case, it is necessary to either read the
value of the leaf with e.g. `cdb_get()` - or to use a subscription that
includes the referred leafs, and use `cdb_diff_iterate()` when a
notification for that subscription is received.

Some examples

/hosts  
> Means that we subscribe to any changes in the subtree - rooted at
> /hosts. This includes additions or removals of host entries as well as
> changes to already existing host entries.

/hosts/host{www}/interfaces/interface{eth0}/ip  
> Means we are notified when host www changes its IP address on eth0.

/hosts/host/interfaces/interface/ip  
> Means we are notified when any host changes any of its IP addresses.

/hosts/host/interfaces  
> Means we are notified when either an interface is added/removed or
> when an individual leaf element in an existing interface is changed.

The `priority` value is an integer. When CDB is changed, the change is
performed inside a transaction. Either a `commit` operation from the CLI
or a `candidate-commit` operation in NETCONF means that the running
database is changed. These changes occur inside a ConfD transaction. CDB
will handle the subscriptions in lock-step priority order. First all
subscribers at the lowest priority are handled, once they all have
replied and synchronized through calls to
`cdb_sync_subscription_socket()` the next set - at the next priority
level is handled by CDB. Priority numbers are global, i.e. if there are
multiple client daemons notifications will still be delivered in
priority order per all subscriptions, not per daemon.

See `cdb_diff_iterate()` and cdb_diff_match() for ways of filtering
subscription notifications and finding out what changed. The easiest way
is though to not use either of the two above mentioned diff function but
to solely rely on the positioning of the subscription points in the tree
to figure out what changed.

`cdb_subscribe()` returns a `subscription point` in the return parameter
`spoint`. This integer value is used to identify this particular
subscription.

Because there can be many subscriptions on the same socket the client
must notify ConfD when it is done subscribing and ready to receive
notifications. This is done using `cdb_subscribe_done()`.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH,
CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int cdb_oper_subscribe(
    int sock, int nspace, int *spoint, const char *fmt, ...);

Sets up a CDB subscription for changes in the operational data base.
Similar to the subscriptions for configuration data, we can be notified
of changes to the operational data stored in CDB. Note that there are
several differences from the subscriptions for configuration data:

- Notifications are only generated if the writer has taken a
  subscription lock, see `cdb_start_session2()` above.

- Priorities are not used for these notifications.

- It is not possible to receive the previous value for modified leafs in
  `cdb_diff_iterate()`.

- A special synchronization reply must be used when the notifications
  have been read (see `cdb_sync_subscription_socket()` below).

    int cdb_subscribe2(
    int sock, enum cdb_sub_type type, int flags, int priority, int *spoint, 
    int nspace, const char *fmt, ...);

This function supersedes the current `cdb_subscribe()` and
`cdb_oper_subscribe()` as well as makes it possible to use the new two
phase subscription method. The `cdb_sub_type` is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
enum cdb_sub_type {
    CDB_SUB_RUNNING = 1,
    CDB_SUB_RUNNING_TWOPHASE = 2,
    CDB_SUB_OPERATIONAL = 3
};
```

</div>

The CDB subscription type `CDB_SUB_RUNNING` is the same as
`cdb_subscribe()`, `CDB_SUB_OPERATIONAL` is the same as
`cdb_oper_subscribe()`, and `CDB_SUB_RUNNING_TWOPHASE` does a two phase
subscription.

The flags argument should be set to 0, or a combination of:

`CDB_SUB_WANT_ABORT_ON_ABORT`  
> Normally if a subscriber is the one to abort a transaction it will not
> receive an abort notification. This flags means that this subscriber
> wants an abort notification even if it was the one that called
> cdb_sub_abort_trans(). This flag is only valid when the subscription
> type is `CDB_SUB_RUNNING_TWOPHASE`.

The two phase subscriptions work like this: A subscriber uses
`cdb_subscribe2()` with the type set to `CDB_SUB_RUNNING_TWOPHASE` to
register as many subscription points as required. The
`cdb_subscribe_done()` function is used to indicate that no more
subscription points will be registered on that particular socket. Only
after `cdb_subscribe_done()` is called will subscription notifications
be delivered.

Once a transaction enters prepare state all CDB two phase subscribers
will be notified in priority order (lowest priority first, subscribers
with the same priority is delivered in parallel). The
`cdb_read_subscription_socket2()` function will set type to
`CDB_SUB_PREPARE`. Once all subscribers have acknowledged the
notification by using the function
`cdb_sync_subscription_socket(CDB_DONE_PRIORITY)` they will subsequently
be notified when the transaction is committed. The `CDB_SUB_COMMIT`
notification is the same as the current subscription mechanism, so when
a transaction is committed all subscribers will be notified (again in
priority order).

When a transaction is aborted, delivery of any remaining
`CDB_SUB_PREPARE` notifications is cancelled. The subscribers that had
already been notified with `CDB_SUB_PREPARE` will be notified with
`CDB_SUB_ABORT` (This notification will be done in reverse order of the
`CDB_SUB_PREPARE` notification). The transaction could be aborted
because one of the subscribers that received `CDB_SUB_PREPARE` called
`cdb_sub_abort_trans()`, but it could also be caused for other reasons,
for example another data provider (than CDB) can abort the transaction.

    int cdb_subscribe_done(
    int sock);

When a client is done registering all its subscriptions on a particular
subscription socket it must call `cdb_subscribe_done()`. No
notifications will be delivered until then.

    int cdb_trigger_subscriptions(
    int sock, int sub_points[], int len);

This function makes it possible to trigger CDB subscriptions for
configuration data even though the configuration has not been modified.
The caller will trigger all subscription points passed in the sub_points
array (or all subscribers if the array is of zero length) in priority
order, and the call will not return until the last subscriber has called
cdb_sync_subscription_socket().

The call is blocking and doesn't return until all subscribers have
acknowledged the notification. That means that it is not possible to use
`cdb_trigger_subscriptions()` in a cdb subscriber process (without
forking a process or spawning a thread) since it would cause a deadlock.

The subscription notification generated by this "synthetic" trigger will
seem like a regular subscription notification to a subscription client.
As such, it is possible to use `cdb_diff_iterate()` to traverse the
changeset. CDB will make up this changeset in which all leafs in the
configuration will appear to be set, and all list entries and presence
containers will appear as if they are created.

If the client is a two-phase subscriber, a prepare notification will
first be delivered and if any client aborts this synthetic transaction
further delivery of subscription notification is suspended and an error
is returned to the caller of `cdb_trigger_subscriptions()`. The error is
the result of mapping the CONFD_ERRCODE as set by the aborting client as
described for MAAPI in the [EXTENDED ERROR
REPORTING](section3.md#confd_lib_lib.extended_error_reporting) section in the
[confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib) manpage. Note however that the
configuration is still the way it is - so it is up to the caller of
`cdb_trigger_subscriptions()` to take appropriate action (for example:
raising an alarm, restarting a subsystem, or even rebooting the system).

If one or more subscription ids is passed in the subids array that are
not valid, an error (`CONFD_ERR_PROTOUSAGE`) will be returned and no
subscriptions will be triggered. If no subscription ids are passed this
error can not occur (even if there aren't any subscribers).

    int cdb_trigger_oper_subscriptions(
    int sock, int sub_points[], int len, int flags);

This function works like `cdb_trigger_subscriptions()`, but for CDB
subscriptions to operational data. The caller will trigger all
subscription points passed in the `sub_points` array (or all operational
data subscribers if the array is of zero length), and the call will not
return until the last subscriber has called
cdb_sync_subscription_socket().

Since the generation of subscription notifications for operational data
requires that the subscription lock is taken (see
`cdb_start_session2()`), this function implicitly attempts to take a
"global" subscription lock. If the subscription lock is already taken,
the function will by default return CONFD_ERR with `confd_errno` set to
CONFD_ERR_LOCKED. To instead have it wait until the lock becomes
available, CDB_LOCK_WAIT can be passed for the `flags` parameter.

    int cdb_replay_subscriptions(
    int sock, struct cdb_txid *txid, int sub_points[], int len);

This function makes it possible to replay the subscription events for
the last configuration change to some or all CDB subscribers. This call
is useful in a number of recovery scenarios, where some CDB subscribers
lost connection to ConfD before having received all the changes in a
transaction. The replay functionality is only available if it has been
enabled in confd.conf

The caller specifies the transaction id of the last transaction that the
application has completely seen and acted on. This verifies that the
application has only missed (part of) the last transaction. If a
different (older) transaction ID is specified, an error is returned and
no subscriptions will be triggered. If the transaction id is the latest
transaction ID (i.e. the caller is already up to date) nothing is
triggered and CONFD_OK is returned.

By calling this function, the caller will potentially trigger all
subscription points passed in the sub_points array (or all subscribers
if the array is of zero length). The subscriptions will be triggered in
priority order, and the call will not return until the last subscriber
has called cdb_sync_subscription_socket().

The call is blocking and doesn't return until all subscribers have
acknowledged the notification. That means that it is not possible to use
`cdb_replay_subscriptions()` in a cdb subscriber process (without
forking a process or spawning a thread) since it would cause a deadlock.

The subscription notification generated by this "synthetic" trigger will
seem like a regular subscription notification to a subscription client.
It is possible to use `cdb_diff_iterate()` to traverse the changeset.

If the client is a two-phase subscriber, a prepare notification will
first be delivered and if any client aborts this synthetic transaction
further delivery of subscription notification is suspended and an error
is returned to the caller of `cdb_replay_subscriptions()`. The error is
the result of mapping the CONFD_ERRCODE as set by the aborting client as
described for MAAPI in the [EXTENDED ERROR
REPORTING](section3.md#confd_lib_lib.extended_error_reporting) section in the
[confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib) manpage.

    int cdb_read_subscription_socket(
    int sock, int sub_points[], int *resultlen);

The subscription socket - which is acquired through a call to
`cdb_connect()` - must be part of the application poll set. Once the
subscription socket has I/O ready to read, we must call
`cdb_read_subscription_socket()` on the subscription socket.

The call will fill in the result in the array `sub_points` with a list
of integer values containing *subscription points* earlier acquired
through calls to `cdb_subscribe()`. The global variable
`cdb_active_subscriptions` can be read to find how many active
subscriptions the application has. Make sure the `sub_points[]` array is
at least this big, otherwise the confd library will write in unallocated
memory.

The subscription points may be either for configuration data or
operational data (if `cdb_oper_subscribe()` has been used on the same
socket), but they will all be of the same "type" - i.e. a single call of
the function will never deliver a mix of configuration and operational
data subscription points.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

    int cdb_read_subscription_socket2(
    int sock, enum cdb_sub_notification *type, int *flags, int *subpoints[], 
    int *resultlen);

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
enum cdb_sub_notification {
    CDB_SUB_PREPARE = 1,

};
```

</div>

This is another version of the `cdb_read_subscription_socket()` with two
important differences:

1.  In this version *subpoints is allocated by the library*, and it is
    up to the caller of this function to `free()` it when it is done.

2.  It is possible to retrieve the type of the subscription notification
    via the `type` return parameter.

All parameters except `sock` are return parameters. It is legal to pass
in `flags` and `type` as `NULL` pointers (in which case type and flags
cannot be retrieved). `subpoints` is an array of integers, the length is
indicated in `resultlen`, it is allocated by the library, and *must be
freed by the caller*. The `type` parameter is what the subscriber uses
to distinguish the different types of subscription notifications.

The `flags` return parameter can have the following bits set:

`CDB_SUB_FLAG_IS_LAST`  
> This bit is set when this notification is the last of its type for
> this subscription socket.

`CDB_SUB_FLAG_HA_IS_SECONDARY`  
> This bit is set when NCS runs in HA mode, and the current node is an
> HA secondary. It is a convenient way for the subscriber to know when
> invoked on a secondary and adjust, or possibly skip, processing.

`CDB_SUB_FLAG_TRIGGER`  
> This bit is set when the cause of the subscription notification is
> that someone called `cdb_trigger_subscriptions()`.

`CDB_SUB_FLAG_REVERT`  
> If a confirming commit is aborted it will look to the CDB subscriber
> as if a transaction happened that is the reverse of what the original
> transaction was. This bit will be set when such a transaction is the
> cause of the notification. Note that for a two-phase subscriber both a
> prepare and a commit notification is delivered. However it is not
> possible to reply by calling `cdb_sub_abort_trans()` for the prepare
> notification in this case, instead the subscriber will have to take
> appropriate backup action if it needs to abort (for example: raise an
> alarm, restart, or even reboot the system).

`CDB_SUB_FLAG_HA_SYNC`  
> This bit is set when the cause of the subscription notification is
> initial synchronization of a HA secondary from CDB on the primary.

    int cdb_diff_iterate(
    int sock, int subid, enum cdb_iter_ret (*iter
          kp, enum cdb_iter_op op, 
    confd_value_t *oldv, confd_value_t *newv, void *state, int flags, void *initstate);

After reading the subscription socket the `cdb_diff_iterate()` function
can be used to iterate over the changes made in CDB data that matched
the particular subscription point given by `subid`.

The user defined function `iter()` will be called for each element that
has been modified and matches the subscription. The `iter()` callback
receives the `confd_hkeypath_t kp` which uniquely identifies which node
in the data tree that is affected, the operation, and optionally the
values it has before and after the transaction. The `op` parameter gives
the modification as:

MOP_CREATED  
> The list entry, `presence` container, or leaf of type `empty` (unless
> in a `union`, see the C_EMPTY section in
> [confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types)) given by `kp` has been created.

MOP_DELETED  
> The list entry, `presence` container, or optional leaf given by `kp`
> has been deleted.
>
> If the subscription was triggered because an ancestor was deleted, the
> `iter()` function will not called at all if the delete was above the
> subscription point. However if the flag ITER_WANT_ANCESTOR_DELETE is
> passed to `cdb_diff_iterate()` then deletes that trigger a descendant
> subscription will also generate a call to `iter()`, and in this case
> `kp` will be the path that was actually deleted.

MOP_MODIFIED  
> A descendant of the list entry given by `kp` has been modified.

MOP_VALUE_SET  
> The value of the leaf given by `kp` has been set to `newv`.

MOP_MOVED_AFTER  
> The list entry given by `kp`, in an `ordered-by user` list, has been
> moved. If `newv` is NULL, the entry has been moved first in the list,
> otherwise it has been moved after the entry given by `newv`. In this
> case `newv` is a pointer to an array of key values identifying an
> entry in the list. The array is terminated with an element that has
> type C_NOEXISTS.

By setting the `flags` parameter ITER_WANT_REVERSE two-phase subscribers
may use this function to traverse the reverse changeset in case of
CDB_SUB_ABORT notification. In this scenario a two-phase subscriber
traverses the changes in the prepare phase (CDB_SUB_PREPARE
notification) and if the transaction is aborted the subscriber may
iterate the inverse to the changes during the abort phase (CDB_SUB_ABORT
notification).

For configuration subscriptions, the previous value of the node can also
be passed to `iter()` if the `flags` parameter contains ITER_WANT_PREV,
in which case `oldv` will be pointing to it (otherwise NULL). For
operational data subscriptions, the ITER_WANT_PREV flag is ignored, and
`oldv` is always NULL - there is no equivalent to CDB_PRE_COMMIT_RUNNING
that holds "old" operational data.

If `iter()` returns ITER_STOP, no more iteration is done, and CONFD_OK
is returned. If `iter()` returns ITER_RECURSE iteration continues with
all children to the node. If `iter()` returns ITER_CONTINUE iteration
ignores the children to the node (if any), and continues with the node's
sibling, and if `iter()` returns ITER_UP the iteration is continued with
the node's parents sibling. If, for some reason, the `iter()` function
wants to return control to the caller of `cdb_diff_iterate()` *before*
all the changes has been iterated over it can return ITER_SUSPEND. The
caller then has to call `cdb_diff_iterate_resume()` to continue/finish
the iteration.

The `state` parameter can be used for any user supplied state (i.e.
whatever is supplied as `initstate` is passed as `state` to `iter()` in
each invocation).

By default the traverse order is undefined but guaranteed to be the most
efficient one. The traverse order may be changed by setting setting a
bit in the `flags` parameter:

ITER_WANT_SCHEMA_ORDER  
> The `iter()` function will be invoked in *schema* order (i.e. in the
> order in which the elements are defined in the YANG file).

ITER_WANT_LEAF_FIRST_ORDER  
> The `iter()` function will be invoked for leafs first, then non-leafs.

ITER_WANT_LEAF_LAST_ORDER  
> The `iter()` function will be invoked for non-leafs first, then leafs.

If the `flags` parameter ITER_WANT_SUPPRESS_OPER_DEFAULTS is given,
operational default values will be skipped during iteration.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS,
CONFD_ERR_BADSTATE, CONFD_ERR_PROTOUSAGE.

    int cdb_diff_iterate_resume(

          kp, 
    enum cdb_iter_op op, confd_value_t *oldv, confd_value_t *newv, void *state, 
    void *resumestate);

The application *must* call this function whenever an iterator function
has returned `ITER_SUSPEND` to finish up the iteration. If the
application does not wish to continue iteration it must at least call
`cdb_diff_iterate_resume(s, ITER_STOP, NULL, NULL);` to clean up the
state. The `reply` parameter is what the iterator function would have
returned (i.e. normally ITER_RECURSE or ITER_CONTINUE) if it hadn't
returned ITER_SUSPEND. Note that it is up to the iterator function to
somehow communicate that it has returned ITER_SUSPEND to the caller of
`cdb_diff_iterate()`, this can for example be a field in a struct for
which a pointer to can passed back and forth in the
`state`/`resumestate` variable.

    int cdb_diff_match(
    int sock, int subid, struct xml_tag tags[], int tagslen);

This function can be invoked when a subscription point has fired.
Similar to the `confd_hkp_tagmatch()` function it takes an argument
which is an array of XML tags. The function will invoke
`cdb_diff_iterate()` on a subscription socket. Using combinations of
`ITER_STOP`, `ITER_CONTINUE` and `ITER_RECURSE` return values, the
function checks a tagpath and decides whether any changes (under the
subscription point) has occurred that also match the provided path
`tags`. It is slightly easier to use this function than
`cdb_diff_iterate()` but can also be slower since it is a general
purpose matcher.

If we have a subscription point at /root, we could invoke this function
as:

<div class="informalexample">

    struct xml_tag tags[] = {{root_root, root__ns},
                             {root_servers, root__ns},
                             {root_server, root__ns}};
    /* /root/servers/server */
    int retv = cdb_diff_match(subsock, subpoint, tags, 3);

</div>

The function returns 1 if there were any changes under `subpoint` that
matched `tags`, 0 if no match was found and `CONFD_ERR` on error.

    int cdb_get_modifications(
    int sock, int subid, int flags, confd_tag_value_t **values, int *nvalues, 
    const char *fmt, ...);

The `cdb_get_modifications()` function can be called after reception of
a subscription notification to retrieve all the changes that caused the
subscription notification. The socket `s` is the subscription socket,
the subscription id must also be provided. Optionally a path can be used
to limit what is returned further (only changes below the supplied path
will be returned), if this isn't needed fmt can be set to `NULL`.

When `cdb_get_modifications()` returns `CONFD_OK`, the results are in
`values`, which is a tag value array with length `nvalues`. The library
allocates memory for the results, which must be free:d by the caller.
This can in all cases be done with code like this:

<div class="informalexample">

    confd_tag_value_t *values;
    int nvalues, i;

    if (cdb_get_modifications(sock, subid, flags, &values, &nvalues,
                              "/some/path") == CONFD_OK) {
        ...
        for (i = 0; i < nvalues; i++)
            confd_free_value(CONFD_GET_TAG_VALUE(&values[i]));
        free(values);
    }

</div>

The tag value array differs somewhat between how it is described in the
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) manual page, most notably only the
values that were modified in this transaction are included. In addition
to that these are the different values of the tags depending on what
happened in the transaction:

- A leaf of type `empty` that has been deleted has the value of
  `C_NOEXISTS`, and when it is created it has the value `C_XMLTAG`.

- A leaf or a leaf-list that has been set to a new value (or its default
  value) is included with that new value. If the leaf or leaf-list is
  optional, then when it is deleted the value is `C_NOEXISTS`.

- Presence containers are included when they are created or when they
  have modifications below them (by the usual `C_XMLBEGIN`, `C_XMLEND`
  pair). If a presence container has been deleted its tag is included,
  but has the value `C_NOEXISTS`.

By default `cdb_get_modifications()` does not include list instances
(created, deleted, or modified) - but if the
`CDB_GET_MODS_INCLUDE_LISTS` flag is included in the `flags` parameter,
list instances will be included. To receive information about where a
list instance in an ordered-by user list is moved, the
`CDB_GET_MODS_INCLUDE_MOVES` flag must also be included in the `flags`
parameter. To receive information about ancestor list entry or presence
container deletion the `CDB_GET_MODS_WANT_ANCESTOR_DELETE` flag must
also be included in the `flags` parameter. Created, modified and moved
instances are included wrapped in the `C_XMLBEGIN` / `C_XMLEND` pair,
with the keys first. A list instance moved to the beginning of the list
is indicated by `C_XMLMOVEFIRST` after the keys. A list instance moved
elsewhere is indicated by `C_XMLMOVEAFTER` after the keys, with the
after-keys following directly after. Deleted list instances instead
begin with `C_XMLBEGINDEL`, then follows the keys, immediately followed
by a `C_XMLEND`.

If the `CDB_GET_MODS_SUPPRESS_DEFAULTS` flag is included in the `flags`
parameter, a default value that comes into effect for a leaf due to an
ancestor list entry or presence container being created will not be
included, and a default value that comes into effect for a leaf due to a
set value being deleted will be included as a deletion (i.e. with value
`C_NOEXISTS`).

When processing a `CDB_SUB_ABORT` notification for a two phase
subscription, it is also possible to request a list of "reverse"
modifications instead of the normal "forward" list. This is done by
including the `CDB_GET_MODS_REVERSE` flag in the `flags` parameter.

    int cdb_get_modifications_iter(
    int sock, int flags, confd_tag_value_t **values, int *nvalues);

The `cdb_get_modifications_iter()` is basically a convenient short-hand
of the `cdb_get_modifications()` function intended to be used from
within a iteration function started by `cdb_diff_iterate()`. In this
case no subscription id is needed, and the path is implicitly the
current position in the iteration.

Combining this call with `cdb_diff_iterate()` makes it for example
possible to iterate over a list, and for each list instance fetch the
changes using `cdb_get_modifications_iter()`, and then return
`ITER_CONTINUE` to process next instance.

> **Note**  
>  
> Note: The `CDB_GET_MODS_REVERSE` flag is ignored by
> `cdb_get_modifications_iter()`. It will instead return a "forward" or
> "reverse" list of modifications for a `CDB_SUB_ABORT` notification

    int cdb_get_modifications_cli(
    int sock, int subid, int flags, char **str);

The `cdb_get_modifications_cli()` function can be called after reception
of a subscription notification to retrieve all the changes that caused
the subscription notification as a string in Cisco CLI format. The
socket `s` is the subscription socket, the subscription id must also be
provided. The `flags` parameter is a bitmask with the following bits:

ITER_WANT_CLI_ORDER  
> When subscription is triggered by `cdb_trigger_subscriptions()` this
> flag ensures that modifications are in the same order as they would be
> if triggered by a real commit. Use of this flag negatively impacts
> performance and memory consumption during the
> cdb_get_modifications_cli call.

The CLI string is malloc(3)ed by the library, and the caller must free
the memory using free(3) when it is not needed any longer.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

    int cdb_sync_subscription_socket(
    int sock, enum cdb_subscription_sync_type st);

Once we have read the subscription notification through a call to
`cdb_read_subscription_socket()` and optionally used the
`cdb_diff_iterate()` to iterate through the changes as well as acted on
the changes to CDB, we must synchronize with CDB so that CDB can
continue and deliver further subscription messages to subscribers with
higher priority numbers.

There are four different types of synchronization replies the
application can use in the `enum cdb_subscription_sync_type` parameter:

`CDB_DONE_PRIORITY`  
> This means that the application has acted on the subscription
> notification and CDB can continue to deliver further notifications.

`CDB_DONE_SOCKET`  
> This means that we are done. But regardless of priority, CDB shall not
> send any further notifications to us on our socket that are related to
> the currently executing transaction.

`CDB_DONE_TRANSACTION`  
> This means that CDB should not send any further notifications to any
> subscribers - including ourselves - related to the currently executing
> transaction.

`CDB_DONE_OPERATIONAL`  
> This should be used when a subscription notification for operational
> data has been read. It is the only type that should be used in this
> case, since the operational data does not have transactions and the
> notifications do not have priorities.

When using two phase subscriptions and `cdb_read_subscription_socket2()`
has returned the type as `CDB_SUB_PREPARE` or `CDB_SUB_ABORT` the only
valid response is `CDB_DONE_PRIORITY`.

For configuration data, the transaction that generated the subscription
notifications is pending until all notifications have been acknowledged.
A read lock on CDB is in effect while notifications are being delivered,
preventing writes until delivery is complete.

For operational data, the writer that generated the subscription
notifications is not directly affected, but the "subscription lock"
remains in effect until all notifications have been acknowledged - thus
subsequent attempts to obtain a "global" subscription lock, or a
subscription lock using CDB_LOCK_PARTIAL for a non-disjuct subtree, will
fail or block while notifications are being delivered (see
`cdb_start_session2()` above). Write operations that don't attempt to
obtain the subscription lock will proceed independent of the delivery of
subscription notifications.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

    int cdb_sub_progress(
    int sock, const char *fmt, ...);

After receiving a subscription notification (using
`cdb_read_subscription_socket()`) but before acknowledging it (or
aborting, in the case of prepare subscriptions), it is possible to send
progress reports back to ConfD using the `cdb_sub_progress()` function.
The socket `sock` must be the subscription socket, and it is allowed to
call the function more than once to display more than one message. It is
also possible to use this function in the diff-iterate callback
function. A newline at the end of the string isn't necessary.

Depending on which north-bound interface that triggered the transaction,
the string passed may be reported by that interface. Currently this is
only presented in the CLI when the operator requests detailed reporting
using the `commit | details` command.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

    int cdb_sub_abort_trans(
    int sock, enum confd_errcode code, uint32_t apptag_ns, uint32_t apptag_tag, 
    const char *fmt);

This function is to be called instead of
`cdb_sync_subscription_socket()` when the subscriber wishes to abort the
current transaction. It is only valid to call after
`cdb_read_subscription_socket2()` has returned with type set to
`CDB_SUB_PREPARE`. The arguments after sock are the same as to
`confd_X_seterr_extended()` and give the caller a way of indicating the
reason for the failure. Details can be found in the [EXTENDED ERROR
REPORTING](section3.md#confd_lib_lib.extended_error_reporting) section in the

This function does the same as `cdb_sub_abort_trans()`, and additionally
gives the possibility to provide contents for the NETCONF \<error-info\>
element. See the [EXTENDED ERROR

    int cdb_get_user_session(
    int sock);

Returns the user session id for the transaction that triggered the
current subscription notification. This function uses a subscription
socket, and can only be called when a subscription notification for
configuration data has been received on that socket, before
`cdb_sync_subscription_socket()` has been called. Additionally, it is
not possible to call this function from the `iter()` function passed to
`cdb_diff_iterate()`. To retrieve full information about the user
session, use `maapi_get_user_session()` (see
[confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi)).

`cdb_sync_subscription_socket()` has been called. Additionally, it is
not possible to call this function from the `iter()` function passed to

This function reads a value from the path in `fmt` and writes the result
into the result parameter `confd_value_t`. The path must lead to a leaf
element in the XML data tree. Note that for the C_BUF, C_BINARY, C_LIST,
C_OBJECTREF, C_OID, C_QNAME, C_HEXSTR, and C_BITBIG `confd_value_t`
types, the buffer(s) pointed to are allocated using malloc(3) - it is up

    int sock, uint32_t *rval, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()` which is used to read `uint32` values.

    int cdb_get_u_int64(
    int sock, uint64_t *rval, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()` which is used to read `uint64` values.

    int cdb_get_bit32(
    int sock, uint32_t *rval, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()` which is used to read `bits` values
where the highest assigned bit position for the type is 31.

    int cdb_get_bit64(
    int sock, uint64_t *rval, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()` which is used to read `bits` values
where the highest assigned bit position for the type is above 31 and
below 64.

    int sock, unsigned char **rval, int *bufsiz, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()` which is used to read `bits` values
where the highest assigned bit position for the type is above 63. Upon
successful return `rval` is pointing to a buffer of size `bufsiz`. It is
up to the user of this function to free the buffer using free(3) when it
is not needed any longer.

    int cdb_get_ipv4(
    int sock, struct in_addr *rval, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()` which is used to read
`inet:ipv4-address` values.

    int cdb_get_ipv6(
    int sock, struct in6_addr *rval, const char *fmt, ...);

values.

    int cdb_get_enum_value(
    int sock, int32_t *rval, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()` which is used to read enumeration
values. If we have:

<div class="informalexample">

    typedef unboundedType {
      type enumeration {
        enum unbounded;
        enum infinity;
      }
    }

</div>

The two enumeration values `unbounded` and `infinity` will occur as two
\#define integers in the .h file which is generated from the YANG
module. Thus this function `cdb_get_enum_value()` populates an unsigned
integer pointer.

    int cdb_get_objectref(
    int sock, confd_hkeypath_t **rval, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()` which is used to read
`instance-identifier` values. Upon successful return `rval` is pointing
to an allocated `confd_hkeypath_t`. It is up to the user of this
function to free the hkeypath using `confd_free_hkeypath()` when it is
not needed any longer.

    int cdb_get_oid(
    int sock, struct confd_snmp_oid **rval, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()` which is used to read
`object-identifier` values. Upon successful return `rval` is pointing to
an allocated `struct confd_snmp_oid`. It is up to the user of this
function to free the struct using free(3) when it is not needed any
longer.

    int cdb_get_buf(
    int sock, unsigned char **rval, int *bufsiz, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()` which is used to read `string` values.
Upon successful return `rval` is pointing to a buffer of size `bufsiz`.
It is up to the user of this function to free the buffer using free(3)
when it is not needed any longer.

    int cdb_get_buf2(
    int sock, unsigned char *rval, int *n, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()` which is used to read `string` values.
If the buffer returned by `cdb_get()` fits into `*n` bytes CONFD_OK is
returned and the buffer is copied into `*rval`. Upon successful return
`*n` is set to the number of bytes copied into `*rval`.

    int cdb_get_str(
    int sock, char *rval, int n, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()` which is used to read `string` values.
If the buffer returned by `cdb_get()` plus a terminating NUL fits into
`n` bytes CONFD_OK is returned and the buffer is copied into `*rval` (as
well as a terminating NUL character).

    int cdb_get_binary(
    int sock, unsigned char **rval, int *bufsiz, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()`, as `cdb_get_buf()` but for `binary`
values. Upon successful return `rval` is pointing to a buffer of size
`bufsiz`. It is up to the user of this function to free the buffer using
free(3) when it is not needed any longer.

    int cdb_get_hexstr(
    int sock, unsigned char **rval, int *bufsiz, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()`, as `cdb_get_buf()` but for
`yang:hex-string` values. Upon successful return `rval` is pointing to a
buffer of size `bufsiz`. It is up to the user of this function to free
the buffer using free(3) when it is not needed any longer.

    int cdb_get_qname(
    int sock, unsigned char **prefix, int *prefixsz, unsigned char **name, 
    int *namesz, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()` which is used to read `xs:QName`
values. Note that `prefixsz` can be zero (in which case `*prefix` will
be set to NULL). The space for prefix and name is allocated using
`malloc()`, it is up to the user of this function to free them when no
longer in use.

    int cdb_get_list(
    int sock, confd_value_t **values, int *n, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()` which is used to read values of a YANG
`leaf-list`. The function will `malloc()` an array of `confd_value_t`
elements for the list, and return a pointer to the array via the
`**values` parameter and the length of the array via the `*n` parameter.
The caller must free the memory for the values (see `cdb_get()`) and the
array itself. An example that reads and prints the elements of a list of
strings:

<div class="informalexample">

    confd_value_t *values = NULL;
    int i, n = 0;

    cdb_get_list(sock, &values, &n, "/system/cards");
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("card %d: %s\n", i, CONFD_GET_BUFPTR(&values[i]));
        confd_free_value(&values[i]);
    }
    free(values);

</div>

    int cdb_get_ipv4prefix(
    int sock, struct confd_ipv4_prefix *rval, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()` which is used to read
`inet:ipv4-prefix` values.

    int cdb_get_ipv6prefix(
    int sock, struct confd_ipv6_prefix *rval, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()` which is used to read
`inet:ipv6-prefix` values.

    int cdb_get_decimal64(
    int sock, struct confd_decimal64 *rval, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()` which is used to read `decimal64`
values.

    int cdb_get_identityref(
    int sock, struct confd_identityref *rval, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()` which is used to read `identityref`
values.

    int cdb_get_ipv4_and_plen(
    int sock, struct confd_ipv4_prefix *rval, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()` which is used to read
`tailf:ipv4-address-and-prefix-length` values.

    int cdb_get_ipv6_and_plen(
    int sock, struct confd_ipv6_prefix *rval, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()` which is used to read
`tailf:ipv6-address-and-prefix-length` values.

    int cdb_get_dquad(
    int sock, struct confd_dotted_quad *rval, const char *fmt, ...);

Type safe variant of `cdb_get()` which is used to read
`yang:dotted-quad` values.

    int cdb_vget(
    int sock, confd_value_t *v, const char *fmt, va_list args);

This function does the same as `cdb_get()`, but takes a single `va_list`
argument instead of a variable number of arguments - i.e. similar to
`vprintf()`. Corresponding `va_list` variants exist for all the
functions that take a path as a variable number of arguments.

    int cdb_get_object(
    int sock, confd_value_t *values, int n, const char *fmt, ...);

In some cases it can be motivated to read multiple values in one
request - this will be more efficient since it only incurs a single
round trip to ConfD, but usage is a bit more complex. This function
reads at most `n` values from the container or list entry specified by
the path, and places them in the `values` array, which is provided by
the caller. The array is populated according to the specification of the
*Value Array* format in the *XML STRUCTURES* section of the
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) manual page.

When reading from a container or list entry with mixed configuration and
operational data (i.e. a config container or list entry that has some
number of operational elements), some elements will have the "wrong"
type - i.e. operational data in a session for CDB_RUNNING/CDB_STARTUP,
or config data in a session for CDB_OPERATIONAL. Leaf elements of the
"wrong" type will have a "value" of C_NOEXISTS in the array, while
static or (existing) optional sub-container elements will have C_XMLTAG
in all cases. Sub-containers or leafs provided by external data
providers will always be represented with C_NOEXISTS, whether config or
not.

On success, the function returns the actual number of elements in the
container or list entry. I.e. if the return value is bigger than `n`,
only the values for the first `n` elements are in the array, and the
remaining values have been discarded. Note that given the specification
of the array contents, there is always a fixed upper bound on the number
of actual elements, and if there are no presence sub-containers, the
number is constant.

As an example, with the YANG fragment in the
[PATHS](section3.md#confd_lib_cdb.paths) section above, this code could be
used to read the values for interface "eth0" on host "buzz":

<div class="informalexample">

    char *path = "/hosts/host{buzz}/interfaces/interface{%s}";
    confd_value_t v[4];
    struct in_addr ip, mask;
    int enabled;

    cdb_get_object(sock, v, 4, path, "eth0");
    /* v[0] is interface name, already known
       - must be freed since it's a C_BUF   */
    confd_free_value(&v[0]);
    ip = CONFD_GET_IPV4(&v[1]);
    mask = CONFD_GET_IPV4(&v[2]);
    enabled = CONFD_GET_BOOL(&v[3]);

</div>

In this simple example, we assumed that the application was aware of the
details of the data model, specifically that a `confd_value_t` array of
length 4 would be sufficient for the values we wanted to retrieve, and
at which positions in the array those values could be found. If we make
use of schema information loaded from the ConfD daemon into the library
(see [confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types)), we can avoid "hardwiring"
these details. The following, more complex, example does the same as the
above, but using only the names (in the form of \#defines from the
header file generated by `confdc --emit-h`) of the relevant leafs:

<div class="informalexample">

    char *path = "/hosts/host{buzz}/interfaces/interface{%s}";
    struct confd_cs_node *object = confd_cs_node_cd(NULL, path);
    struct confd_cs_node *cur;
    int n = confd_max_object_size(object);
    int i;
    confd_value_t v[n];
    struct in_addr ip, mask;
    int enabled;

    cdb_get_object(sock, v, n, path, "eth0");
    for (cur = object->children, i = 0;
         cur != NULL;
         cur = confd_next_object_node(object, cur, &v[i]), i++) {
        switch (cur->tag) {
        case hst_ip:
            ip = CONFD_GET_IPV4(&v[i]);
            break;
        case hst_mask:
            mask = CONFD_GET_IPV4(&v[i]);
            break;
        case hst_enabled:
            enabled = CONFD_GET_BOOL(&v[i]);
            break;
        }
        /* always free - it is a no-op if not needed */
        confd_free_value(&v[i]);
    }

</div>

See [confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib) for the specification of
the `confd_max_object_size()` and `confd_next_object_node()` functions.
Also worth noting is that the return value from
`confd_max_object_size()` is a constant for a given node in a given data
model - thus we could optimize the above by calling
`confd_max_object_size()` only at the first invocation of
`cdb_get_object()` for a given node, making use of the `opaque` element
of `struct confd_cs_node` to store the value:

<div class="informalexample">

    char *path = "/hosts/host{buzz}/interfaces/interface{%s}";
    struct confd_cs_node *object = confd_cs_node_cd(NULL, path);
    int n;
    struct in_addr ip, mask;
    int enabled;

    if (object->opaque == NULL) {
        n = confd_max_object_size(object);
        object->opaque = (void *)n;
    } else {
        n = (int)object->opaque;
    }

    {
        struct confd_cs_node *cur;
        confd_value_t v[n];
        int i;

        cdb_get_object(sock, v, n, path, "eth0");
        for (cur = object->children, i = 0;
             cur != NULL;
             cur = confd_next_object_node(object, cur, &v[i]), i++) {
            ...
        }
    }

</div>

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH

    int cdb_get_objects(
    int sock, confd_value_t *values, int n, int ix, int nobj, const char *fmt, 
    ...);

Similar to `cdb_get_object()`, but reads multiple entries of a list
based on the "instance integer" otherwise given within square brackets
in the path - here the path must specify the list without the instance
integer. At most `n` values from each of `nobj` entries, starting at
entry `ix`, are read and placed in the `values` array.

The array must be at least `n * nobj` elements long, and the values for
list entry `ix + i` start at element `array[i * n]` (i.e. `ix` starts at
`array[0]`, `ix+1` at `array[n]`, and so on). On success, the highest
actual number of values in any of the list entries read is returned. An
error (CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS) will be returned if we attempt to read more
entries than actually exist (i.e. if `ix + nobj - 1` is outside the
range of actually existing list entries). Example - read the data for
all interfaces on the host "buzz" (assuming that we have memory enough
for that):

<div class="informalexample">

    char *path = "/hosts/host{buzz}/interfaces/interface";
    int n;

    n = cdb_num_instances(sock, path);
    {
        confd_value_t v[n*4];
        char name[n][64];
        struct in_addr ip[n], mask[n];
        int enabled[n];
        int i;

        cdb_get_objects(sock, v, 4, 0, n, path);
        for (i = 0; i < n*4; i += 4) {
            confd_pp_value(&name[i][0], 64, &v[i]);
            /* value must be freed since it's a C_BUF */
            confd_free_value(&v[i]);
            ip[i] = CONFD_GET_IPV4(&v[i+1]);
            mask[i] = CONFD_GET_IPV4(&v[i+2]);
            enabled[i] = CONFD_GET_BOOL(&v[i+3]);
        }

        /* configure interfaces... */
    }

</div>

This simple example can of course be enhanced to use loaded schema
information in a similar manner as for `cdb_get_object()` above.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH,
CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int cdb_get_values(
    int sock, confd_tag_value_t *values, int n, const char *fmt, ...);

Read an arbitrary set of sub-elements of a container or list entry. The
`values` array must be pre-populated with `n` values based on the
specification of the *Tagged Value Array* format in the *XML STRUCTURES*
section of the [confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) manual page, where
the `confd_value_t` value element is given as follows:

- C_NOEXISTS means that the value should be read from CDB and stored in
  the array.

- C_PTR also means that the value should be read from CDB, but instead
  gives the expected type and a pointer to the type-specific variable
  where the value should be stored. Thus this gives a functionality
  similar to the type safe versions of `cdb_get()`.

- C_XMLBEGIN and C_XMLEND are used as per the specification.

- Key values to select list entries can be given with their values.

- As a special case, the "instance integer" can be used to select a list
  entry by using C_CDBBEGIN instead of C_XMLBEGIN (and no key values).

All elements have the same position in the array after the call, in
order to simplify extraction of the values - this means that optional
elements that were requested but didn't exist will have C_NOEXISTS
rather than being omitted from the array. However requesting a list
entry that doesn't exist, or requesting non-CDB data, or operational vs
config data, is an error. Note that when using C_PTR, the only
indication of a non-existing value is that the destination variable has
not been modified - it's up to the application to set it to some
"impossible" value before the call when optional leafs are read.

In this rather complex example we first read only the "name" and
"enabled" values for all interfaces, and then read "ip" and "mask" for
those that were enabled - a total of two requests. Note that since the
"interface" list begin/end elements are in the array, the path must not
include the "interface" component. When reading values from a single
container, it is generally simpler to have the container component (and
keys or instance integer) in the path instead.

<div class="informalexample">

    int cdb_get_case(
    int sock, const char *choice, confd_value_t *rcase, const char *fmt, ...);

When we use the YANG `choice` statement in the data model, this function
can be used to find the currently selected `case`, avoiding useless
`cdb_get()` etc requests for elements that belong to other cases. The
`fmt, ...` arguments give the path to the container or list entry where
the choice is defined, and `choice` is the name of the choice. The case
value is returned to the `confd_value_t` that `rcase` points to, as type
C_XMLTAG - i.e. we can use the `CONFD_GET_XMLTAG()` macro to retrieve
the hashed tag value. If no case is currently selected (i.e. for an
optional choice that doesn't have a default case), the function will
fail with CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS.

If we have "nested" choices, i.e. multiple levels of `choice` statements
without intervening `container` or `list` statements in the data model,
the `choice` argument must give a '/'-separated path with alternating
choice and case names, from the data node given by the `fmt, ...`
arguments to the specific choice that the request pertains to.

The `attrs` parameter is an array of attributes of length `num_attrs`,
specifying the wanted attributes - if `num_attrs` is 0, all attributes
are retrieved. If no attributes are found, `*num_vals` is set to 0,
otherwise an array of `confd_attr_value_t` elements is allocated and
populated, its address stored in `*attr_vals`, and `*num_vals` is set to
the number of elements in the array. The `confd_attr_value_t` struct is
defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
typedef struct confd_attr_value {
    uint32_t attr;
    confd_value_t v;
} confd_attr_value_t;
```

</div>

If any attribute values are returned (`*num_vals` \> 0), the caller must
free the allocated memory by calling `confd_free_value()` for each of
the `confd_value_t` elements, and `free(3)` for the `*attr_vals` array
itself.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS, CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS,
CONFD_ERR_BADPATH, CONFD_ERR_BADTYPE

    int cdb_vget_attrs(
    int sock, uint32_t *attrs, int num_attrs, confd_attr_value_t **attr_vals, 
    int *num_vals, const char *fmt, va_list args);

This function does the same as `cdb_get_attrs()`, but takes a single
`va_list` argument instead of a variable number of arguments - i.e.
similar to `vprintf()`. Corresponding `va_list` variants exist for all
the functions that take a path as a variable number of arguments.

### Operational Data

It is possible for an application to store operational data (i.e. status
and statistical information) in CDB, instead of providing it on demand
via the callback interfaces described in the
[confd_lib_dp(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_dp) manual page. The operational
database has no transactions and normally avoids the use of locks in
order to provide light-weight access methods, however when the
multi-value API functions below are used, all updates requested by a
given function call are carried out atomically. Read about how to
specify the storage of operational data in CDB via the `tailf:cdb-oper`
extension in the
[tailf_yang_extensions(5)](section5.md#tailf_yang_extensions) manual page.

To establish a session for operational data, the application needs to
use `cdb_connect()` with CDB_DATA_SOCKET and `cdb_start_session()` with
CDB_OPERATIONAL. After this, all the read and access functions above are
available for use with operational data, and additionally the write
functions described below. Configuration data can not be accessed in a
session for operational data, nor vice versa - however it is possible to
have both types of sessions active simultaneously on two different
sockets, or to alternate the use of one socket via `cdb_end_session()`.
The write functions can never be used in a session for configuration
data.

> **Note**  
>  
> In order to trigger subscriptions on operational data, we must obtain
> a subscription lock via the use of `cdb_start_session2()` instead of
> `cdb_start_session()`, see above.

In YANG it is possible to define a list of operational data without any
keys. For this type of list, we use a single "pseudo" key which is
always of type C_INT64. This key isn't visible in the northbound agent
interfaces, but is used in the functions described here just as if it
was a "normal" key.

    int cdb_set_elem(
    int sock, confd_value_t *val, const char *fmt, ...);

    int cdb_set_elem2(
    int sock, const char *strval, const char *fmt, ...);

There are two different functions to set the value of a single leaf. The
first takes the value from a `confd_value_t` struct, the second takes
the string representation of the value.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH,
CONFD_ERR_BADTYPE, CONFD_ERR_NOT_WRITABLE

    int cdb_vset_elem(
    int sock, confd_value_t *val, const char *fmt, va_list args);

This function does the same as `cdb_set_elem()`, but takes a single
`va_list` argument instead of a variable number of arguments - i.e.
similar to `vprintf()`. Corresponding `va_list` variants exist for all
the functions that take a path as a variable number of arguments.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH,
CONFD_ERR_BADTYPE, CONFD_ERR_NOT_WRITABLE

    int cdb_create(
    int sock, const char *fmt, ...);

Create a new list entry, presence container, or leaf of type `empty`
(unless in a `union`, see the C_EMPTY section in
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types)). Note that for list entries and
containers, sub-elements will not exist until created or set via some of
the other functions, thus doing implicit create via `cdb_set_object()`
or `cdb_set_values()` may be preferred in this case.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH,
CONFD_ERR_NOT_WRITABLE, CONFD_ERR_NOTCREATABLE, CONFD_ERR_ALREADY_EXISTS

    int cdb_delete(
    int sock, const char *fmt, ...);

Delete a list entry, presence container, or leaf of type `empty` (unless
in a `union` see the C_EMPTY section in
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types)), and all its child elements (if
any).

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH,
CONFD_ERR_NOT_WRITABLE, CONFD_ERR_NOTDELETABLE, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int cdb_set_object(
    int sock, const confd_value_t *values, int n, const char *fmt, ...);

Set all elements corresponding to the complete contents of a container
or list entry, except for sub-lists. The `values` array must be
populated with `n` values according to the specification of the *Value
Array* format in the *XML STRUCTURES* section of the
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) manual page.

If the container or list entry itself, or any sub-elements that are
specified as existing, do not exist before this call, they will be
created, otherwise the existing values will be updated. Non-mandatory
leafs and presence containers that are specified as not existing in the
array, i.e. with value C_NOEXISTS, will be deleted if they existed
before the call.

When writing to a container with mixed configuration and operational
data (i.e. a config container or list entry that has some number of
operational elements), all config leaf elements must be specified as
C_NOEXISTS in the corresponding array elements, while config
sub-container elements are specified with C_XMLTAG just as for
operational data.

For a list entry, since the key elements must be present in the array,
it is not required that the key values are included in the path given by
`fmt`. If the key values *are* included in the path, the values of the
key elements in the array are ignored.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH,
CONFD_ERR_BADTYPE, CONFD_ERR_NOT_WRITABLE

    int cdb_set_values(
    int sock, const confd_tag_value_t *values, int n, const char *fmt, ...);

Set arbitrary sub-elements of a container or list entry. The `values`
array must be populated with `n` values according to the specification
of the *Tagged Value Array* format in the *XML STRUCTURES* section of
the [confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) manual page.

If the container or list entry itself, or any sub-elements that are
specified as existing, do not exist before this call, they will be
created, otherwise the existing values will be updated. Both mandatory
and optional elements may be omitted from the array, and all omitted
elements are left unchanged. To actually delete a non-mandatory leaf or
presence container as described for `cdb_set_object()`, it may (as an
extension of the format) be specified as C_NOEXISTS instead of being
omitted.

For a list entry, the key values can be specified either in the path or
via key elements in the array - if the values are in the path, the key
elements can be omitted from the array. For sub-lists present in the
array, the key elements must of course always also be present though,
immediately following the C_XMLBEGIN element and in the order defined by
the data model. It is also possible to delete a list entry by using a
C_XMLBEGINDEL element, followed by the keys in data model order,
followed by a C_XMLEND element.

For a list without keys (see above), the "pseudo" key may (or in some
cases must) be present in the array, but of course there is no tag value
for it, since it isn't present in the data model. In this case we must
use a tag value of 0, i.e. it can be set with code like:

<div class="informalexample">

    confd_tag_value_t tv[7];

    CONFD_SET_TAG_INT64(&tv[1], 0, 42);

</div>

The same method is used when reading data from such a list with the
`cdb_get_values()` function described above.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH,
CONFD_ERR_BADTYPE, CONFD_ERR_NOT_WRITABLE

    int cdb_set_case(
    int sock, const char *choice, const char *scase, const char *fmt, ...);

When we use the YANG `choice` statement in the data model, this function
can be used to select the current `case`. When configuration data is
modified by northbound agents, the current case is implicitly selected
(and elements for other cases potentially deleted) by the setting of
elements in a choice. For operational data in CDB however, this is under
direct control of the application, which needs to explicitly set the
current case. Setting the case will also automatically delete elements
belonging to other cases, but it is up to the application to not set any
elements in the "wrong" case.

The `fmt, ...` arguments give the path to the container or list entry
where the choice is defined, and `choice` and `scase` are the choice and
case names. For an optional choice, it is possible to have no case at
all selected. To indicate that the previously selected case should be
deleted without selecting another case, we can pass NULL for the `scase`
argument.

If we have "nested" choices, i.e. multiple levels of `choice` statements
without intervening `container` or `list` statements in the data model,
the `choice` argument must give a '/'-separated path with alternating
choice and case names, from the data node given by the `fmt, ...`
arguments to the specific choice that the request pertains to.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH,
CONFD_ERR_NOTDELETABLE

    int cdb_set_attr(
    int sock, uint32_t attr, confd_value_t *v, const char *fmt, ...);

This function sets an attribute for a path in `fmt`. The path must lead
to an operational config node. See `cdb_get_attrs` for the supported
attributes.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH,
CONFD_ERR_BADTYPE, CONFD_ERR_NOT_WRITABLE, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int cdb_vset_attr(
    int sock, uint32_t attr, confd_value_t *v, const char *fmt, va_list args);

This function does the same as `cdb_set_attr()`, but takes a single
`va_list` argument instead of a variable number of arguments - i.e.
similar to `vprintf()`. Corresponding `va_list` variants exist for all
the functions that take a path as a variable number of arguments.

### Ncs Specific Functions

    struct confd_cs_node *cdb_cs_node_cd(
    int sock, const char *fmt, ...);

Does the same thing as `confd_cs_node_cd()` (see
[confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib)), but can handle paths that are
ambiguous due to traversing a mount point, by sending a request to the
NSO daemon. To be used when `confd_cs_node_cd()` returns `NULL` with
`confd_errno` set to `CONFD_ERR_NO_MOUNT_ID`.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH

### Library

ConfD Library, (`libconfd`, `-lconfd`)

### Description

The `libconfd` shared library is used to connect to the ConfD Data
Provider API. The purpose of this API is to provide callback hooks so
that user-written data providers can provide data stored externally to
ConfD. ConfD needs this information in order to drive its northbound
agents.

The library is also used to populate items in the data model which are
not data or configuration items, such as statistics items from the
device.

The library consists of a number of API functions whose purpose is to
install different callback functions at different points in the data
model tree which is the representation of the device configuration. Read
more about callpoints in
[tailf_yang_extensions(5)](section5.md#tailf_yang_extensions). Read more
about how to use the library in the User Guide chapters on Operational
data and External data.

### Functions

    struct confd_daemon_ctx *confd_init_daemon(
    const char *name);

Initializes a new daemon context or returns NULL on failure. For most of
the library functions described here a daemon_ctx is required, so we
must create a daemon context before we can use them. The daemon context
contains a `d_opaque` pointer which can be used by the application to
pass application specific data into the callback functions.

The `name` parameter is used in various debug printouts and and is also
used to uniquely identify the daemon. The `confd --status` will use this
name when indicating which callpoints are registered.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_PROTOUSAGE

    int confd_set_daemon_flags(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, int flags);

This function modifies the API behaviour according to the flags ORed
into the `flags` argument. It should be called immediately after
creating the daemon context with `confd_init_daemon()`. The following
flags are available:

`CONFD_DAEMON_FLAG_STRINGSONLY`  
> If this flag is used, the callback functions described below will only
> receive string values for all instances of `confd_value_t` (i.e. the
> type is always `C_BUF`). The callbacks must also give only string
> values in their reply functions. This feature can be useful for
> proxy-type applications that are unaware of the types of all elements,
> i.e. data model agnostic.

`CONFD_DAEMON_FLAG_REG_REPLACE_DISCONNECT`  
> By default, if one daemon replaces a callpoint registration made by
> another daemon, this is only logged, and no action is taken towards
> the daemon that has "lost" its registration. This can be useful in
> some scenarios, e.g. it is possible to have an "initial default"
> daemon providing "null" data for many callpoints, until the actual
> data provider daemons have registered. If a daemon uses the
> `CONFD_DAEMON_FLAG_REG_REPLACE_DISCONNECT` flag, it will instead be
> disconnected from ConfD if any of its registrations are replaced by
> another daemon, and can take action as appropriate.

`CONFD_DAEMON_FLAG_NO_DEFAULTS`  
> This flag tells ConfD that the daemon does not store default values.
> By default, ConfD assumes that the daemon doesn't know about default
> values, and thus whenever default values come into effect, ConfD will
> issue `set_elem()` callbacks to set those values, even if they have
> not actually been set by the northbound agent. Similarly `set_case()`
> will be issued with the default case for choices that have one.
>
> When the `CONFD_DAEMON_FLAG_NO_DEFAULTS` flag is set, ConfD will only
> issue `set_elem()` callbacks when values have been explicitly set, and
> `set_case()` when a case has been selected by explicitly setting an
> element in the case. Specifically:
>
> - When a list entry or presence container is created, there will be no
>   callbacks for descendant leafs with default value, or descendant
>   choices with default case, unless values have been explicitly set.
>
> - When a leaf with a default value is deleted, a `remove()` callback
>   will be issued instead of a `set_elem()` with the default value.
>
> - When the current case in a choice with default case is deleted
>   without another case being selected, the `set_case()` callback will
>   be invoked with the case value given as NULL instead of the default
>   case.
>
> > [!NOTE]
> > A daemon that has the `CONFD_DAEMON_FLAG_NO_DEFAULTS` flag set
> > *must* reply to `get_elem()` and the other callbacks that request
> > leaf values with a value of type C_DEFAULT, rather than the actual
> > default value, when the default value for a leaf is in effect. It
> > *must* also reply to `get_case()` with C_DEFAULT when the default
> > case is in effect.

`CONFD_DAEMON_FLAG_PREFER_BULK_GET`  
> This flag requests that the `get_object()` callback rather than
> `get_elem()` should be used whenever possible, regardless of whether a
> "bulk hint" is given by the northbound agent. If `get_elem()` is not
> registered, the flag is not useful (it has no effect - `get_object()`
> is always used anyway), but in cases where the callpoint also covers
> leafs that cannot be retrieved with `get_object()`, the daemon *must*
> register `get_elem()`.

`CONFD_DAEMON_FLAG_BULK_GET_CONTAINER`  
> This flag tells ConfD that the data provider is prepared to handle a
> `get_object()` callback invocation for the toplevel ancestor container
> when a leaf is requested by a northbound agent, if there exists no
> ancestor list node but there exists such a container. If this flag is
> not set, `get_object()` is only invoked for list entries, and
> `get_elem()` is always used for leafs that do not have an ancestor
> list node. If both `get_object()` and `get_elem()` are registered, the
> choice between them is made as for list entries, i.e. based on a "bulk
> hint" from the northbound agent unless the flag
> `CONFD_DAEMON_FLAG_PREFER_BULK_GET` is also set (see above).

    void confd_release_daemon(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx);

Returns all memory that has been allocated by `confd_init_daemon()` and
other functions for the daemon context. The control socket as well as
all the worker sockets must be closed by the application (before or
after `confd_release_daemon()` has been called).

    int confd_connect(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, int sock, enum confd_sock_type type, const struct sockaddr *srv, 
    int addrsz);

Connects to the ConfD daemon. The `dx` parameter is a daemon context
acquired through a call to `confd_init_daemon()`.

There are two different types of connected sockets between an external
daemon and ConfD.

`CONTROL_SOCKET`  
> The first socket that is connected must always be a control socket.
> All requests from ConfD to create new transactions will arrive on the
> control socket, but it is also used for a number of other requests
> that are expected to complete quickly - the general rule is that all
> callbacks that do not have a corresponding `init()` callback are in
> fact control socket requests. There can only be one control socket for
> a given daemon context.

`WORKER_SOCKET`  
> We must always create at least one worker socket. All transaction,
> data, validation, and action callbacks, except the `init()` callbacks,
> use a worker socket. It is possible for a daemon to have multiple
> worker sockets, and the `init()` callback (see e.g.
> `confd_register_trans_cb()`) must indicate which worker socket should
> be used for the subsequent requests. This makes it possible for an
> application to be multi-threaded, where different threads can be used
> for different transactions.

Returns CONFD_OK when successful or CONFD_ERR on connection error.

> **Note**  
>  
> All the callbacks that are invoked via these sockets are subject to
> timeouts configured in `confd.conf`, see
> [confd.conf(5)](section5.md#ncs.conf). The callbacks invoked via the
> control socket must generate a reply back to ConfD within the time
> configured for /confdConfig/capi/newSessionTimeout, the callbacks
> invoked via a worker socket within the time configured for
> /confdConfig/capi/queryTimeout. If either timeout is exceeded, the
> daemon will be considered dead, and ConfD will disconnect it by
> closing the control and worker sockets.

> **Note**  
>  
> If this call fails (i.e. does not return CONFD_OK), the socket
> descriptor must be closed and a new socket created before the call is
> re-attempted.

    int confd_register_trans_cb(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, const struct confd_trans_cbs *trans);

This function registers transaction callback functions. A transaction is
a ConfD concept. There may be multiple sources of data for the device
configuration.

In order to orchestrate transactions with multiple sources of data,
ConfD implements a two-phase commit protocol towards all data sources
that participate in a transaction.

Each NETCONF operation will be an individual ConfD transaction. These
transactions are typically very short lived. Transactions originating
from the CLI or the Web UI have longer life. The ConfD transaction can
be viewed as a conceptual state machine where the different phases of
the transaction are different states and the invocations of the callback
functions are state transitions. The following ASCII art depicts the
state machine.

Transactions can be performed towards fours different kind of storages.

`CONFD_CANDIDATE`  
> If the system has been configured so that the external database owns

> the external database will never see any CONFD_CANDIDATE transactions.

`CONFD_RUNNING`  
> This is a transaction towards the actual running configuration of the
> device. All write operations in a CONFD_RUNNING transaction must be
> propagated to the individual subsystems that use this configuration
> data.

`CONFD_STARTUP`  
> If the system has ben configured to support the NETCONF startup
> capability, this is a transaction towards the startup database.

`CONFD_OPERATIONAL`  
> This value indicates a transaction towards writable operational data.
> This transaction is used only if there are non-config data marked as
> `tailf:writable true` in the YANG module.
>
> Currently, these transaction are only started by the SNMP agent, and
> only when writable operational data is SET over SNMP.

Which type we have is indicated through the `confd_dbname` field in the
`confd_trans_ctx`.

A transaction, regardless of whether it originates from the NETCONF
agent, the CLI or the Web UI, has several distinct phases:

`init()`  
> This callback must always be implemented. All other callbacks are
> optional. This means that if the callback is set to NULL, ConfD will
> treat it as an implicit CONFD_OK. `libconfd` will allocate a
> transaction context on behalf of the transaction and give this newly
> allocated structure as an argument to the `init()` callback. The
> structure is defined as:

All the callback functions (except `interrupt()`) must return CONFD_OK,
CONFD_DELAYED_RESPONSE or CONFD_ERR.

It is often useful to associate an error string with a CONFD_ERR return
value. This can be done through a call to `confd_trans_seterr()` or
`confd_trans_seterr_extended()`.

Depending on the situation (original caller) the error string gets
propagated to the CLI, the Web UI or the NETCONF manager.

    int confd_register_db_cb(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, const struct confd_db_cbs *dbcbs);

We may also optionally have a set of callback functions which span over
several ConfD transactions.

If the system is configured in such a way so that the external database
owns the candidate data store we must implement four callback functions
to do this. If ConfD owns the candidate the candidate callbacks should
be set to NULL.

If ConfD owns the candidate, ConfD has been configured to support
`confirmed-commit` and the *revertByCommit* isn't enabled, then three
checkpointing functions must be implemented; otherwise these should be
set to NULL. When `confirmed-commit` is enabled, the user can commit the
candidate with a timeout. Unless a confirming commit is given by the
user before the timer expires, the system must rollback to the previous
running configuration. This mechanism is controlled by the checkpoint
callbacks. If the revertByCommit feature is enabled the potential
rollback to previous running configuration is done using normal reversed
commits, hence no checkpointing support is required in this case. See
further below.

An external database may also (optionally) support the lock/unlock and
lock_partial/unlock_partial operations. This is only interesting if
there exists additional locking mechanisms towards the database - such
as an external CLI which can lock the database, or if the external
database owns the candidate.

Finally, the external database may optionally validate a candidate
configuration. Configuration validation is preferably done through
ConfD - however if a system already has implemented extensive
configuration validation - the `candidate_validate()` callback can be
used.

The `struct confd_db_cbs` structure looks like:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_db_cbs {
    int (*candidate_commit)(struct confd_db_ctx *dbx, int timeout);
    int (*candidate_confirming_commit)(struct confd_db_ctx *dbx);
    int (*candidate_reset)(struct confd_db_ctx *dbx);
    int (*candidate_chk_not_modified)(struct confd_db_ctx *dbx);
    int (*candidate_rollback_running)(struct confd_db_ctx *dbx);
    int (*candidate_validate)(struct confd_db_ctx *dbx);
    int (*add_checkpoint_running)(struct confd_db_ctx *dbx);
    int (*del_checkpoint_running)(struct confd_db_ctx *dbx);
    int (*activate_checkpoint_running)(struct confd_db_ctx *dbx);
    int (*copy_running_to_startup)(struct confd_db_ctx *dbx);
    int (*running_chk_not_modified)(struct confd_db_ctx *dbx);
    int (*lock)(struct confd_db_ctx *dbx, enum confd_dbname dbname);
    int (*unlock)(struct confd_db_ctx *dbx, enum confd_dbname dbname);
    int (*lock_partial)(struct confd_db_ctx *dbx, enum confd_dbname dbname,
                        int lockid, confd_hkeypath_t paths[], int npaths);
    int (*unlock_partial)(struct confd_db_ctx *dbx, enum confd_dbname dbname,
                          int lockid);
    int (*delete_config)(struct confd_db_ctx *dbx, enum confd_dbname dbname);
};
```

</div>

If we have an externally implemented candidate, that is if confd.conf
item /confdConfig/datastores/candidate/implementation is set to
"external", we must implement the 5 candidate callbacks. Otherwise
(recommended) they must be set to NULL.

If implementation is "external", all databases (if there are more than
one) MUST take care of the candidate for their part of the configuration
data tree. If ConfD is configured to use an external database for parts
of the configuration, and the built-in CDB database is used for some
parts, CDB will handle the candidate for its part. See also
`misc/extern_candidate` in the examples collection.

The callback functions are are the following:

`candidate_commit()`  
> This function should copy the candidate DB into the running DB. If
> `timeout` != 0, we should be prepared to do a rollback or act on a
> `candidate_confirming_commit()`. The `timeout` parameter can not be
> used to set a timer for when to rollback; this timer is handled by the
> ConfD daemon. If we terminate without having acted on the
> `candidate_confirming_commit()`, we MUST restart with a rollback. Thus
> we must remember that we are waiting for a
> `candidate_confirming_commit()` and we must do so on persistent
> storage. Must only be implemented when the external database owns the
> candidate.

`candidate_confirming_commit()`  
> If the `timeout` in the `candidate_commit()` function is != 0, we will
> be either invoked here or in the `candidate_rollback_running()`
> function within `timeout` seconds. `candidate_confirming_commit()`
> should make the commit persistent, whereas a call to
> `candidate_rollback_running()` would copy back the previous running
> configuration to running.

`candidate_rollback_running()`  
> If for some reason, apart from a timeout, something goes wrong, we get
> invoked in the `candidate_rollback_running()` function. The function
> should copy back the previous running configuration to running.

`candidate_reset()`  
> This function is intended to copy the current running configuration
> into the candidate. It is invoked whenever the NETCONF operation
> `<discard-changes>` is executed or when a lock is released without
> committing.

`candidate_chk_not_modified()`  
> This function should check to see if the candidate has been modified
> or not. Returns CONFD_OK if no modifications has been done since the
> last commit or reset, and CONFD_ERR if any uncommitted modifications
> exist.

`candidate_validate()`  
> This callback is optional. If implemented, the task of the callback is
> to validate the candidate configuration. Note that the running
> database can be validated by the database in the `prepare()` callback.
> `candidate_validate()` is only meaningful when an explicit validate
> operation is received, e.g. through NETCONF.

`add_checkpoint_running()`  
> This function should be implemented only when ConfD owns the
> candidate, confirmed-commit is enabled and revertByCommit is disabled.
>
> It is responsible for creating a checkpoint of the current running
> configuration and storing the checkpoint in non-volatile memory. When
> the system restarts this function should check if there is a
> checkpoint available, and use the checkpoint instead of running.

`del_checkpoint_running()`  
> This function should delete a checkpoint created by
> `add_checkpoint_running()`. It is called by ConfD when a confirming
> commit is received unless revertByCommit is enabled.

`activate_checkpoint_running()`  
> This function should rollback running to the checkpoint created by
> `add_checkpoint_running()`. It is called by ConfD when the timer
> expires or if the user session expires unless revertByCommit is
> enabled.

`copy_running_to_startup()`  
> This function should copy running to startup. It only needs to be
> implemented if the startup data store is enabled.

`running_chk_not_modified()`  
> This function should check to see if running has been modified or not.
> It only needs to be implemented if the startup data store is enabled.
> Returns CONFD_OK if no modifications have been done since the last
> copy of running to startup, and CONFD_ERR if any modifications exist.

`lock()`  
> This should only be implemented if our database supports locking from
> other sources than through ConfD. In this case both the lock/unlock
> and lock_partial/unlock_partial callbacks must be implemented. If a
> lock on the whole database is set through e.g. NETCONF, ConfD will
> first make sure that no other ConfD transaction has locked the
> database. Then it will call `lock()` to make sure that the database is
> not locked by some other source (such as a non-ConfD CLI). Returns
> CONFD_OK on success, and CONFD_ERR if the lock was already held by an
> external entity.

`unlock()`  
> Unlocks the database.

`lock_partial()`  
> This should only be implemented if our database supports locking from
> other sources than through ConfD, see `lock()` above. This callback is
> invoked if a northbound agent requests a partial lock. The `paths[]`
> argument is an `npaths` long array of hkeypaths that identify the
> leafs and/or subtrees that are to be locked. The `lockid` is a
> reference that will be used on a subsequent corresponding
> `unlock_partial()` invocation.

`unlock_partial()`  
> Unlocks the partial lock that was requested with `lockid`.

`delete_config()`  
> Will be called for 'startup' or 'candidate' only. The database is
> supposed to be set to erased.

All the above callback functions must return either CONFD_OK or
CONFD_ERR. If the system is configured so that ConfD owns the candidate,
then obviously the candidate related functions need not be implemented.
If the system is configured to not do confirmed commit,
`candidate_confirming_commit()` and `candidate_commit()` need not to be
implemented.

It is often interesting to associate an error string with a CONFD_ERR
return value. In particular the `validate()` callback must typically
indicate which item was invalid and why. This can be done through a call
to `confd_db_seterr()` or `confd_db_seterr_extended()`.

Depending on the situation (original caller) the error string is
propagated to the CLI, the Web UI or the NETCONF manager.

    int confd_register_data_cb(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, const struct confd_data_cbs *data);

This function registers the data manipulation callbacks. The data model
defines a number of "callpoints". Each callpoint must have an associated
set of data callbacks.

Thus if our database application serves three different callpoints in
the data model we must install three different sets of data manipulation
callbacks - one set at each callpoint.

The data callbacks either return data back to ConfD or they do not. For
example the `create()` callback does not return data whereas the
`get_next()` callback does. All the callbacks that return data do so
through API functions, not by means of return values from the function
itself.

The `struct confd_data_cbs` is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_data_cbs {
    char callpoint[MAX_CALLPOINT_LEN];

};
```

</div>

One of the parameters to the callback is a `confd_hkeypath_t` (h - as in
hashed keypath). This is fully described in
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types).

The `cb_opaque` element can be used to pass arbitrary data to the
callbacks, e.g. when the same set of callbacks is used for multiple
callpoints. It is made available to the callbacks via an element with
the same name in the transaction context (`tctx` argument), see the
structure definition above.

If the `tailf:opaque` substatement has been used with the
`tailf:callpoint` statement in the data model, the argument string is
made available to the callbacks via the `callpoint_opaque` element in
the transaction context.

The `flags` field in the `struct confd_data_cbs` can have the flag
CONFD_DATA_WANT_FILTER set. See the function `get_next()` for details.

When use of the `CONFD_ATTR_INACTIVE` attribute is enabled in the ConfD
configuration (/confdConfig/enableAttributes and
/confdConfig/enableInactive both set to `true`), read callbacks
(`get_elem()` etc) for configuration data must observe the current value
of the `hide_inactive` element in the transaction context. If it is
non-zero, those callbacks must act as if data with the
`CONFD_ATTR_INACTIVE` attribute set does not exist.

The six write callbacks (excluding `write_all()`), namely `set_elem()`,
`create()`, `remove()`, `set_case()`, `set_attr()`, and `move_after()`
may return the value CONFD_ACCUMULATE. If CONFD_ACCUMULATE is returned
the library will accumulate the written values as a linked list of
operations. This list can later be traversed in either of the
transaction callbacks `prepare()` or `commit()`.

This provides trivial transaction support for applications that want to
implement the ConfD two-phase commit protocol but lacks an underlying
database with proper transaction support. The write operations are
available as a linked list of confd_tr_item structs:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_tr_item {
    char *callpoint;
    enum confd_tr_op op;
    confd_hkeypath_t *hkp;
    confd_value_t *val;
    confd_value_t *choice; /* only for set_case */
    uint32_t attr;         /* only for set_attr */
    struct confd_tr_item *next;
};
```

</div>

The list is available in the transaction context in the field
`accumulated`. The entire list and its content will be automatically
freed by the library once the transaction finishes.

    int  confd_register_range_data_cb(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, const struct confd_data_cbs *data, const confd_value_t *lower, 
    const confd_value_t *upper, int numkeys, const char *fmt, ...);

This is a variant of `confd_register_data_cb()` which registers a set of
callbacks for a range of list entries. There can thus be multiple sets
of C functions registered on the same callpoint, even by different
daemons. The `lower` and `upper` parameters are two `numkeys` long
arrays of key values, which define the endpoints of the list range. It
is also possible to do a "default" registration, by giving `lower` and
`upper` as NULL (`numkeys` is ignored). The callbacks for the default
registration will be invoked when the keys are not in any of the
explicitly registered ranges.

The `fmt` and remaining parameters specify a string path for the list
that the keys apply to, in the same form as for the
[confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi) and
[confd_lib_cdb(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_cdb) functions. However if the list
is a sublist to another list, the key element for the parent list(s) may
be completely omitted, to indicate that the registration applies to all
entries for the parent list(s) (similar to CDB subscription paths).

An example that registers one set of callbacks for the range
/servers/server{aaa} - /servers/server{mzz} and another set for
/servers/server{naa} - /servers/server{zzz}:

<div class="informalexample">

    confd_value_t lower, upper;

    CONFD_SET_STR(&lower, "aaa");
    CONFD_SET_STR(&upper, "mzz");
    if (confd_register_range_data_cb(dctx, &data_cb1, &lower, &upper, 1,
                                     "/servers/server") == CONFD_ERR)
        confd_fatal("Failed to register data cb\n");

    CONFD_SET_STR(&lower, "naa");
    CONFD_SET_STR(&upper, "zzz");
    if (confd_register_range_data_cb(dctx, &data_cb2, &lower, &upper, 1,
                                     "/servers/server") == CONFD_ERR)
        confd_fatal("Failed to register data cb\n");

</div>

In this example, as in most cases where this function is used, the data
model defines a list with a single key, and `numkeys` is thus always
`1`. However it can also be used for lists that have multiple keys, in
which case the `upper` and `lower` arrays may be populated with multiple
keys, upto however many keys the data model specifies for the list, and
`numkeys` gives the number of keys in the arrays. If fewer keys than
specified in the data model are given, the registration covers all
possible values for the remaining keys, i.e. they are effectively
wildcarded.

While traversal of a list with range registrations will always invoke
e.g. `get_next()` only for actually registered ranges, it is also
possible that a request from a northbound interface is made for data in
a specific list entry. If the registrations do not cover all possible
key values, such a request could be for a list entry that does not fall
in any of the registered ranges, which will result in a "no
registration" error. To avoid the error, we can either restrict the type
of the keys such that only values that fall in the registered ranges are
valid, or, for operational data, use a "default" registration as
described above. In this case the daemon with the "default" registration
would just reply with `confd_data_reply_not_found()` for all requests
for specific data, and `confd_data_reply_next_key()` with NULL for the
key values for all `get_next()` etc requests.

    int confd_register_usess_cb(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, const struct confd_usess_cbs *ucb);

This function can be used to register information callbacks that are
invoked for user session start and stop. The `struct confd_usess_cbs` is
defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_usess_cbs {
    void (*start)(struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, struct confd_user_info *uinfo);
    void (*stop)(struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, struct confd_user_info *uinfo);
};
```

</div>

Both callbacks are optional. They can be used e.g. for a multi-threaded
daemon to manage a pool of worker threads, by allocating worker threads
to user sessions. In this case we would ideally allocate a worker thread
the first time an `init()` callback for a given user session requires a
worker socket to be assigned, and use only the `stop()` usess callback
to release the worker thread - using the `start()` callback to allocate
a worker thread would often mean that we allocated a thread that was
never used. The `u_opaque` element in the `struct confd_user_info` can
be used to manage such allocations.

> **Note**  
>  
> These callbacks will only be invoked if the daemon has also registered

    int confd_register_done(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx);

When we have registered all the callbacks for a daemon (including the
other types described below if we have them), we must call this function
to synchronize with ConfD. No callbacks will be invoked until it has
been called, and after the call, no further registrations are allowed.

    int confd_fd_ready(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, int fd);

The database application owns all data provider sockets to ConfD and is
responsible for the polling of these sockets. When one of the ConfD
sockets has I/O ready to read, the application must invoke
`confd_fd_ready()` on the socket. This function will:

- Read data from ConfD

- Unmarshal this data

- Invoke the right callback with the right arguments

When this function reads the request from from ConfD it will block on
`read()`, thus if it is important for the application to have
nonblocking I/O, the application must dispatch I/O from ConfD in a
separate thread.

The function returns the return value from the callback function,
normally CONFD_OK (0), or CONFD_ERR (-1) on error and CONFD_EOF (-2)
when the socket to ConfD has been closed. Thus CONFD_ERR can mean either
that the callback function that was invoked returned CONFD_ERR, or that
some error condition occurred within the `confd_fd_ready()` function.
These cases can be distinguished via `confd_errno`, which will be set to
CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL if CONFD_ERR comes from the callback function. Thus a
correct call to `confd_fd_ready()` looks like:

<div class="informalexample">

    struct pollfd set[n];
    /* ...... */

    if (set[0].revents & POLLIN) {
        if ((ret = confd_fd_ready(dctx, mysock)) == CONFD_EOF) {
            confd_fatal("ConfD socket closed\n");
        } else if (ret == CONFD_ERR &&
                   confd_errno != CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL) {
            confd_fatal("Error on ConfD socket request: %s (%d): %s\n",
                        confd_strerror(confd_errno), confd_errno,
                        confd_lasterr());
        }
    }

    void confd_trans_set_fd(
    struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx, int sock);

Associate a worker socket with the transaction, or validation phase.
This function must be called in the transaction and validation `init()`
callbacks - a minimal implementation of a transaction `init()` callback
looks like:

<div class="informalexample">

    static int init(struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx)
    {
        confd_trans_set_fd(tctx, workersock);
        return CONFD_OK;
    }

</div>

    int confd_data_get_list_filter(
    struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx, struct confd_list_filter **filter);

This function is used from `get_next()`, `get_next_object()`,
`find_next()`, or `find_next_object()` to get the filter associated with
the list traversal. The filter is available if the flag
CONFD_DATA_WANT_FILTER is set in the `flags` fields in
`struct confd_data_cbs` when the callback functions are registered.

The filter is only available when the first list entry is requested,
either when the `next` parameter is -1 in `get_next()` or
`get_next_object()`, or in `find_next()` or `find_next_object()`.

This function allocates the filter in `*filter`, and it must be freed by
the data provider with `confd_free_list_filter()` when it is no longer
used.

The filter is of type `struct confd_list_filter`:

If no filter is associated with the request, `*filter` will be set to
NULL.

</div>

The `confd_value_t val` parameter is always a C_BUF, i.e., a string
value, except when the function is `derived-from`,
`derived-from-or-self` or the expression is `origin`. In this case the
value is of type C_IDENTITYREF.

The `node` array never goes into a nested list. In an `exists`
expression, the `node` can refer to a leaf, leaf-list, container or list
node. If it refers to a list node, the test is supposed to be true if
the list is non-empty. In all other expressions, the `node` is
guaranteed to refer to a leaf or leaf-list, possibly in a hierarchy of
containers.

This function is used to return a single data item with its attributes
to ConfD. It combines the functions of `confd_data_reply_value` and
`confd_data_reply_attrs`.

    int confd_data_reply_value_array(
    struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx, const confd_value_t *vs, int n);

This function is used to return an array of values, corresponding to a
complete list entry, to ConfD. It can be used by the optional
`get_object()` callback. The `vs` array is populated with `n` values
according to the specification of the Value Array format in the [XML
STRUCTURES](section3.md#confd_types.xml_structures) section of the
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) manual page.

Values for leaf-lists may be passed as a single array element with type
C_LIST (as described in the specification). A daemon that is *not* using
this flag can alternatively treat the leaf-list as a list, and pass an
element with type C_NOEXISTS in the array, in which case ConfD will
issue separate callback invocations to retrieve the data for the
leaf-list. In case the leaf-list does not exist, these extra invocations
can be avoided by passing a C_LIST with size 0 in the array.

In the easiest case, similar to the "servers" example above, we can
construct a reply array as follows:

<div class="informalexample">

    struct in_addr ip4 = my_get_ip(.....);
    confd_value_t ret[3];

    CONFD_SET_STR(&ret[0], "www");
    CONFD_SET_IPV4(&ret[1], ip4);
    CONFD_SET_UINT16(&ret[2], 80);
    confd_data_reply_value_array(tctx, ret, 3);

</div>

Any containers inside the object must also be passed in the array. For
example an entry in the b list used in the explanation for
`exists_optional()` would have to be passed as:

<div class="informalexample">

    confd_value_t ret[4];

    CONFD_SET_STR(&ret[0], "b_name");
    CONFD_SET_XMLTAG(&ret[1], myprefix_opt, myprefix__ns);
    CONFD_SET_INT32(&ret[2], 77);
    CONFD_SET_NOEXISTS(&ret[3]);

    confd_data_reply_value_array(tctx, ret, 4);

</div>

Thus, a container or a leaf of type `empty` (unless in a `union`, see
the C_EMPTY section of [confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types)) must be
passed as its equivalent XML tag if it exists. But if the type `empty`
leaf is inside a `union` then the `CONFD_SET_EMPTY` macro should be
used. If a `presence` container or leaf of type `empty` does not exist,
it must be passed as a value of C_NOEXISTS. In the example above, the
leaf foo does not exist, thus the contents of position `3` in the array.

If a `presence` container does not exist, its non existing values must
not be passed - it suffices to say that the container itself does not
exist. In the example above, the opt container did exist and thus we
also had to pass the contained value(s), the ii leaf.

Hence, the above example represents:

<div class="informalexample">

    <b>
       <name>b_name</name>
       <opt>
          <ii>77</ii>
       </opt>
    </b>

</div>

    int confd_data_reply_tag_value_array(
    struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx, const confd_tag_value_t *tvs, int n);

This function is used to return an array of values, corresponding to a
complete list entry, to ConfD. It can be used by the optional
`get_object()` callback. The `tvs` array is populated with `n` values
according to the specification of the Tagged Value Array format in the
[XML STRUCTURES](section3.md#confd_types.xml_structures) section of the
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) manual page.

I.e. the difference from `confd_data_reply_value_array()` is that the
values are tagged with the node names from the data model - this means
that non-existing values can simply be omitted from the array, per the
specification above. Additionally the key leafs can be omitted, since
they are already known by ConfD - if the key leafs are included, they
will be ignored. Finally, in e.g. the case of a container with both
config and non-config data, where the config data is in CDB and only the
non-config data provided by the callback, the config elements can be
omitted (for `confd_data_reply_value_array()` they must be included as
C_NOEXISTS elements).

However, although the tagged value array format can represent nested
lists, these must not be passed via this function, since the
`get_object()` callback only pertains to a single entry of one list.
Nodes representing sub-lists must thus be omitted from the array, and
ConfD will issue separate `get_object()` invocations to retrieve the
data for those.

Values for leaf-lists may be passed as a single array element with type
C_LIST (as described in the specification). A daemon that is *not* using
this flag can alternatively treat the leaf-list as a list, and omit it
from the array, in which case ConfD will issue separate callback
invocations to retrieve the data for the leaf-list. In case the
leaf-list does not exist, these extra invocations can be avoided by
passing a C_LIST with size 0 in the array.

Using the same examples as above, in the "servers" case, we can
construct a reply array as follows:

<div class="informalexample">

    struct in_addr ip4 = my_get_ip(.....);
    confd_tag_value_t ret[2];
    int n = 0;

    CONFD_SET_TAG_IPV4(&ret[n], myprefix_ip, ip4); n++;
    CONFD_SET_TAG_UINT16(&ret[n], myprefix_port, 80); n++;
    confd_data_reply_tag_value_array(tctx, ret, n);

</div>

An entry in the b list used in the explanation for `exists_optional()`
would be passed as:

<div class="informalexample">

    confd_tag_value_t ret[3];
    int n = 0;

    CONFD_SET_TAG_XMLBEGIN(&ret[n], myprefix_opt, myprefix__ns); n++;
    CONFD_SET_TAG_INT32(&ret[n], myprefix_ii, 77); n++;
    CONFD_SET_TAG_XMLEND(&ret[n], myprefix_opt, myprefix__ns); n++;
    confd_data_reply_tag_value_array(tctx, ret, n);

</div>

The C_XMLEND element is not strictly necessary in this case, since there
are no subsequent elements in the array. However it would have been
required if the optional foo leaf had existed, thus it is good practice
to always include both the C_XMLBEGIN and C_XMLEND elements for nested
containers (if they exist, that is - otherwise neither must be
included).

    int confd_data_reply_tag_value_attrs_array(
    struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx, const confd_tag_value_attr_t *tvas, int n);

This function is used to return an array of values and attributes,
corresponding to a complete list entry, to ConfD. It can be used by the
optional `get_object()` callback. The `tvas` array is populated with `n`
values and attribute lists according to the specification of the Tagged
Value Attribute Array format in the [XML
STRUCTURES](section3.md#confd_types.xml_structures) section of the
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) manual page.

I.e. the difference from `confd_data_reply_tag_value_array()` is that
not only the values are tagged with the node names from the data model
but also attributes for each node - this means that non-existing
value-attribute pairs can simply be omitted from the array, per the
specification above.

    int confd_data_reply_next_key(
    struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx, const confd_value_t *v, int num_vals_in_key, 
    long next);

This function is used by the `get_next()` and `find_next()` callbacks to
return the next key, or the next leaf-list element in case `get_next()`
is invoked for a leaf-list. A list may have multiple key leafs specified
in the data model. The parameter `num_vals_in_key` indicates the number
of key values, i.e. the length of the `v` array. In the typical case
with a list having just a single key leaf specified, `num_vals_in_key`
is always 1. For a leaf-list, `num_vals_in_key` is always 1.

The `long next` will be passed into the next invocation of the
`get_next()` callback if it has a value other than `-1`. Thus this value
provides a means for the application to traverse the data. Since this is
`long` it is possible to pass a `void*` pointing to the next list entry
in the application - effectively passing a pointer to confd and getting
it back in the next invocation of `get_next()`.

To indicate that no more entries exist, we reply with a NULL pointer for
the `v` array. The values of the `num_vals_in_key` and `next` parameters
are ignored in this case.

Passing the value `-1` for `next` has a special meaning. It tells ConfD
that we want the next request for this list traversal to use the
`find_next()` (or `find_next_object()`) callback instead of `get_next()`
(or `get_next_object()`).

The array of `confd_tag_value_t` elements must be populated in exactly

If we are replying to a `get_next_object()` or `find_next_object()`

`confd_tag_value_attr_t` elements is used instead of `confd_tag_value_t`
in exactly the same manner as for
`confd_data_reply_tag_value_attrs_array()`

    int confd_data_reply_next_object_arrays(
    struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx, const struct confd_next_object *obj, int nobj, 
    int timeout_millisecs);

This function is used by the optional `get_next_object()` and
`find_next_object()` callbacks to return multiple objects including
their keys, in `confd_value_t` form. The `struct confd_next_object` is
defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_next_object {
    confd_value_t *v;
    int n;
    long next;
};
```

</div>

I.e. it corresponds exactly to the data provided for a call of
`confd_data_reply_next_object_array()`. The parameter `obj` is a pointer
to an `nobj` elements long array of such structs. We can also pass a
timeout value for ConfD's caching of the returned data via
`timeout_millisecs`. If we pass 0 for this parameter, the value
configured via /confdConfig/capi/objectCacheTimeout in `confd.conf` (see
[confd.conf(5)](section5.md#ncs.conf)) will be used.

The cache in ConfD may become invalid (e.g. due to timeout) before all
the returned list entries have been used, and ConfD may then need to
issue a new callback request based on an "intermediate" `next` value.
This is done exactly as for the single-entry case, i.e. if `next` is
`-1`, `find_next_object()` (or `find_next()`) will be used, with the
keys from the "previous" entry, otherwise `get_next_object()` (or
`get_next()`) will be used, with the given `next` value.

Thus a data provider can choose to give `next` values that uniquely
identify list entries if that is convenient, or otherwise use `-1` for
all `next` elements - or a combination, e.g. `-1` for all but the last
entry. If any `next` value is given as `-1`, at least one of the
`find_next()` and `find_next_object()` callbacks must be registered.

To indicate the end of the list we can either pass a NULL pointer for
the `obj` array, or pass an array where the last
`struct confd_next_object` element has the `v` element set to NULL. The
latter is preferable, since we can then combine the final list entries
with the end-of-list indication in the reply to a single callback
invocation.

I.e. it corresponds exactly to the data provided for a call of

is a pointer to an `nobj` elements long array of such structs. We can
also pass a timeout value for ConfD's caching of the returned data via
`timeout_millisecs`. If we pass 0 for this parameter, the value
configured via /confdConfig/capi/objectCacheTimeout in `confd.conf` (see

    int confd_data_reply_next_object_tag_value_attrs_arrays(
    struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx, const struct confd_tag_next_object_attrs *toa, 
    int nobj, int timeout_millisecs);

This function is used by the optional `get_next_object()` and
`find_next_object()` callbacks to return multiple objects including
their keys, in `confd_tag_value_attr_t` form. The
`struct confd_tag_next_object_attrs` is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_tag_next_object_attrs {
    confd_tag_value_attr_t *tva;
    int n;
    long next;
};
```

</div>

I.e. it corresponds exactly to the data provided for a call of
`confd_data_reply_next_object_tag_value_attrs_array()`. The parameter
`toa` is a pointer to an `nobj` elements long array of such structs.

I.e. the difference from
`confd_data_reply_next_object_tag_value_arrays()` is that the
`struct confd_tag_next_object_attrs` that has array of `tva` elements is
used instead of `struct confd_tag_next_object` which has array of `tv`.

    int confd_data_reply_attrs(
    struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx, const confd_attr_value_t *attrs, int num_attrs);

This function is used by the `get_attrs()` callback to return the
requested attribute values. The `attrs` array should be populated with
`num_attrs` elements of type `confd_attr_value_t`, which is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
typedef struct confd_attr_value {
    uint32_t attr;
    confd_value_t v;
} confd_attr_value_t;
```

</div>

If multiple attributes were requested in the callback invocation, they
should be given in the same order in the reply as in the request.
Requested attributes that are not set should be omitted from the array.
If none of the requested attributes are set, or no attributes at all are
set when all attributes are requested, `num_attrs` should be given as 0,
and the value of `attrs` is ignored.

    int confd_delayed_reply_ok(
    struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx);

This function must be used to return the equivalent of CONFD_OK when the
actual callback returned CONFD_DELAYED_RESPONSE. I.e. it is appropriate
for a transaction callback, a data callback for a write operation, or a
validation callback, when the result is successful.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_PROTOUSAGE, CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

    int confd_delayed_reply_error(
    struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx, const char *errstr);

This function must be used to return an error when the actual callback
returned CONFD_DELAYED_RESPONSE. There are two cases where the value of
`errstr` has a special significance:

"locked" after invocation of `trans_lock()`  
> This is equivalent to returning CONFD_ALREADY_LOCKED from the
> callback.

"in_use" after invocation of `write_start()` or `prepare()`  
> This is equivalent to returning CONFD_IN_USE from the callback.

In all other cases, calling `confd_delayed_reply_error()` is equivalent
to calling `confd_trans_seterr()` with the `errstr` value and returning
CONFD_ERR from the callback. It is also possible to first call
`confd_trans_seterr()` (for the varargs format) or
`confd_trans_seterr_extended()` etc (for [EXTENDED ERROR
REPORTING](section3.md#confd_lib_lib.extended_error_reporting) as described
in [confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib)), and then call
`confd_delayed_reply_error()` with NULL for `errstr`.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_PROTOUSAGE, CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

    int confd_data_set_timeout(
    struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx, int timeout_secs);

A data callback should normally complete "quickly", since e.g. the
execution of a 'show' command in the CLI may require many data callback
invocations. Thus it should be possible to set the
/confdConfig/capi/queryTimeout in `confd.conf` (see above) such that it
covers the longest possible execution time for any data callback. In
some rare cases it may still be necessary for a data callback to have a
longer execution time, and then this function can be used to extend (or
shorten) the timeout for the current callback invocation. The timeout is
given in seconds from the point in time when the function is called.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

    void confd_trans_seterr(
    struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx, const char *fmt);

This function is used by the application to set an error string. The
next transaction or data callback which returns CONFD_ERR will have this
error description attached to it. This error may propagate to the CLI,
the NETCONF manager, the Web UI or the log files depending on the
situation. We also use this function to propagate warning messages from
the `validate()` callback if we are doing semantic validation in C. The
`fmt` argument is a printf style format string.

    void confd_trans_seterr_extended(
    struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx, enum confd_errcode code, uint32_t apptag_ns, 
    uint32_t apptag_tag, const char *fmt);

This function can be used to provide more structured error information
from a transaction or data callback, see the section [EXTENDED ERROR
REPORTING](section3.md#confd_lib_lib.extended_error_reporting) in
[confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib).

    int confd_trans_seterr_extended_info(
    struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx, enum confd_errcode code, uint32_t apptag_ns, 
    uint32_t apptag_tag, confd_tag_value_t *error_info, int n, const char *fmt);

This function can be used to provide structured error information in the
same way as `confd_trans_seterr_extended()`, and additionally provide
contents for the NETCONF \<error-info\> element. See the section
[EXTENDED ERROR
REPORTING](section3.md#confd_lib_lib.extended_error_reporting) in
[confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib).

    void confd_db_seterr(
    struct confd_db_ctx *dbx, const char *fmt);

This function is used by the application to set an error string. The
next db callback function which returns CONFD_ERR will have this error
description attached to it. This error may propagate to the CLI, the
NETCONF manager, the Web UI or the log files depending on the situation.
The `fmt` argument is a printf style format string.

    void confd_db_seterr_extended(
    struct confd_db_ctx *dbx, enum confd_errcode code, uint32_t apptag_ns, 
    uint32_t apptag_tag, const char *fmt);

This function can be used to provide more structured error information
from a db callback, see the section [EXTENDED ERROR
REPORTING](section3.md#confd_lib_lib.extended_error_reporting) in
[confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib).

    int confd_db_seterr_extended_info(
    struct confd_db_ctx *dbx, enum confd_errcode code, uint32_t apptag_ns, 
    uint32_t apptag_tag, confd_tag_value_t *error_info, int n, const char *fmt);

This function can be used to provide structured error information in the
same way as `confd_db_seterr_extended()`, and additionally provide
contents for the NETCONF \<error-info\> element. See the section
[EXTENDED ERROR
REPORTING](section3.md#confd_lib_lib.extended_error_reporting) in
[confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib).

    int confd_db_set_timeout(
    struct confd_db_ctx *dbx, int timeout_secs);

Some of the DB callbacks registered via `confd_register_db_cb()`, e.g.
`copy_running_to_startup()`, may require a longer execution time than
others, and in these cases the timeout specified for
/confdConfig/capi/newSessionTimeout may be insufficient. This function
can then be used to extend the timeout for the current callback
invocation. The timeout is given in seconds from the point in time when
the function is called.

    int confd_aaa_reload(
    const struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx);

When the ConfD AAA tree is populated by an external data provider (see
the AAA chapter in the Admin Guide), this function can be used by the
data provider to notify ConfD when there is a change to the AAA data.
I.e. it is an alternative to executing the command
`confd --clear-aaa-cache`. See also `maapi_aaa_reload()` in
[confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi).

    int confd_install_crypto_keys(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx* dtx);

It is possible to define DES3 and AES keys inside confd.conf. These keys
are used by ConfD to encrypt data which is entered into the system. The
supported types are `tailf:des3-cbc-encrypted-string`,
`tailf:aes-cfb-128-encrypted-string` and
`tailf:aes-256-cfb-128-encrypted-string`. See
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types).

This function will copy those keys from ConfD (which reads confd.conf)
into memory in the library. The parameter `dtx` is a daemon context
which is connected through a call to `confd_connect()`.

> **Note**  
>  
> The function must be called before `confd_register_done()` is called.

> [confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi).

### Ncs Service Callbacks

NCS service callbacks are invoked in a manner similar to the data
callbacks described above, but require a registration for a service
point, specified as `ncs:servicepoint` in the data model. The `init()`
transaction callback must also be registered, and must use the
`confd_trans_set_fd()` function to assign a worker socket for the
transaction.

    int ncs_register_service_cb(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, const struct ncs_service_cbs *scb);

This function registers the service callbacks. The
`struct ncs_service_cbs` is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct ncs_name_value {
    char *name;
    char *value;
};
```

``` c
enum ncs_service_operation {
    NCS_SERVICE_CREATE = 0,
    NCS_SERVICE_UPDATE = 1,
    NCS_SERVICE_DELETE = 2
};
```

``` c
struct ncs_service_cbs {
    char servicepoint[MAX_CALLPOINT_LEN];

    int (*pre_modification)(struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx,
                            enum ncs_service_operation op, confd_hkeypath_t *kp,
                            struct ncs_name_value *proplist, int num_props);
    int (*create)(struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx, confd_hkeypath_t *kp,
                  struct ncs_name_value *proplist, int num_props,
                  int fastmap_thandle);
    int (*post_modification)(struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx,
                             enum ncs_service_operation op,
                             confd_hkeypath_t *kp,
                             struct ncs_name_value *proplist, int num_props);
    void *cb_opaque; /* private user data    */
};
```

</div>

The `create()` callback is invoked inside NCS FASTMAP when creation or
update of a service instance is committed. It should attach to the
FASTMAP transaction by means of `maapi_attach2()` (see
[confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi)), passing the
`fastmap_thandle` transaction handle as the `thandle` parameter to
`maapi_attach2()`. The `usid` parameter for `maapi_attach2()` should be
given as 0. To modify data in the FASTMAP transaction, the NCS-specific
`maapi_shared_xxx()` functions must be used, see the section [NCS
SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi.ncs_functions) in the
[confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi) manual page.

The `pre_modification()` and `post_modification()` callbacks are
optional, and are invoked outside FASTMAP. `pre_modification()` is
invoked before create, update, or delete of the service, as indicated by
the `enum ncs_service_operation op` parameter. Conversely
`post_modification()` is invoked after create, update, or delete of the
service. These functions can be useful e.g. for allocations that should
be stored and existing also when the service instance is removed.

All the callbacks receive a property list via the `proplist` and
`num_props` parameters. This list is initially empty (`proplist` == NULL
and `num_props` == 0), but it can be used to store and later modify
persistent data outside the service model that might be needed.

> **Note**  
>  
> We must call the `confd_register_done()` function when we are done
> with all registrations for a daemon, see above.

    int ncs_service_reply_proplist(
    struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx, const struct ncs_name_value *proplist, int num_props);

This function must be called with the new property list, immediately
prior to returning from the callback, if the stored property list should
be updated. If a callback returns without calling
`ncs_service_reply_proplist()`, the previous property list is retained.
To completely delete the property list, call this function with the
`num_props` parameter given as 0.

### Validation Callbacks

This library also supports the registration of callback functions on
validation points in the data model. A validation point is a point in
the data model where ConfD will invoke an external function to validate
the associated data. The validation occurs before a transaction is
committed. Similar to the state machine described for "external data
bases" above where we install callback functions in the
`struct confd_trans_cbs`, we have to install callback functions for each
validation point. It does not matter if the database is CDB or an
external database, the validation callbacks described here work equally
well for both cases.

    void confd_register_trans_validate_cb(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, const struct confd_trans_validate_cbs *vcbs);

This function installs two callback functions for the
`struct confd_daemon_ctx`. One function that gets called when the
validation phase starts in a transaction and one when the validation
phase stops in a transaction. In the `init()` callback we can use the
MAAPI api to attach to the running transaction, this way we can later
on, freely traverse the configuration and read data. The data we will be
reading through MAAPI (see [confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi))
will be read from the shadow storage containing the *not-yet-committed*
data.

The `struct confd_trans_validate_cbs` is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_trans_validate_cbs {
    int (*init)(struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx);
    int (*stop)(struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx);
};
```

</div>

It must thus be populated with two function pointers when we call this
function.

The `init()` callback is conceptually invoked at the start of the
validation phase, but just as for transaction callbacks, ConfD will as
far as possible delay the actual invocation of the validation `init()`
callback for a given daemon until it is required. This means that if
none of the daemon's `validate()` callbacks need to be invoked (see
below), `init()` and `stop()` will not be invoked either.

If we need to allocate memory or other resources for the validation this
can also be done in the `init()` callback, with the resources being
freed in the `stop()` callback. We can use the `t_opaque` element in the
`struct confd_trans_ctx` to manage this, but in a daemon that implements
both data and validation callbacks it is better to use the `v_opaque`
element for validation, to be able to manage the allocations
independently.

Similar to the `init()` callback for external data bases, we must in the
`init()` callback associate a file descriptor with the transaction. This
file descriptor will be used for the actual validation. Thus in a multi
threaded application, we can have one thread performing validation for a
transaction in parallel with other threads executing e.g. data
callbacks. Thus a typical implementation of an `init()` callback for
validation looks as:

<div class="informalexample">

    static int init_validation(struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx)
    {
        maapi_attach(maapi_socket, mtest__ns, tctx);
        confd_trans_set_fd(tctx, workersock);
        return CONFD_OK;
    }

</div>

    int confd_register_valpoint_cb(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, const struct confd_valpoint_cb *vcb);

We must also install an actual validation function for each validation
point, i.e. for each `tailf:validate` statement in the YANG data model.

A validation point has a name and an associated function pointer. The
struct which must be populated for each validation point looks like:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_valpoint_cb {
    char valpoint[MAX_CALLPOINT_LEN];
    int (*validate)(struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx, confd_hkeypath_t *kp,
                    confd_value_t *newval);
    void *cb_opaque; /* private user data */
};
```

</div>

> **Note**  
>  
> We must call the `confd_register_done()` function when we are done
> with all registrations for a daemon, see above.

See the user guide chapter "Semantic validation" for code examples. The
`validate()` callback can return CONFD_OK if all is well, or CONFD_ERROR
if the validation fails. If we wish a message to accompany the error we
must prior to returning from the callback, call `confd_trans_seterr()`
or `confd_trans_seterr_extended()`.

The `cb_opaque` element can be used to pass arbitrary data to the
callback, e.g. when the same callback is used for multiple validation
points. It is made available to the callback via the element
`vcb_opaque` in the transaction context (`tctx` argument), see the
structure definition above.

If the `tailf:opaque` substatement has been used with the
`tailf:validate` statement in the data model, the argument string is
made available to the callback via the `validate_opaque` element in the
transaction context.

We also have yet another special return value which can be used (only)
from the `validate()` callback which is CONFD_VALIDATION_WARN. Prior to
return of this value we must call `confd_trans_seterr()` which provides
a string describing the warning. The warnings will get propagated to the
transaction engine, and depending on where the transaction originates,
ConfD may or may not act on the warnings. If the transaction originates
from the CLI or the Web UI, ConfD will interactively present the user
with a choice - whereby the transaction can be aborted.

If the transaction originates from NETCONF - which does not have any
interactive capabilities - the warnings are ignored. The warnings are
primarily intended to alert inexperienced users that attempt to make -
dangerous - configuration changes. There can be multiple warnings from
multiple validation points in the same transaction.

It is also possible to let the `validate()` callback return
CONFD_DELAYED_RESPONSE in which case the application at a later stage
must invoke either `confd_delayed_reply_ok()`,
`confd_delayed_reply_error()` or
`confd_delayed_reply_validation_warn()`.

In some cases it may be necessary for the validation callbacks to verify
the availability of resources that will be needed if the new
configuration is committed. To support this kind of verification, the
`validation_info` element in the `struct confd_trans_ctx` can carry one
of these flags:

CONFD_VALIDATION_FLAG_TEST  
> When this flag is set, the current validation phase is a "test"
> validation, as in e.g. the CLI 'validate' command, and the transaction
> will return to the READ state regardless of the validation result.
> This flag is available in all of the `init()`, `validate()`, and
> `stop()` callbacks.

CONFD_VALIDATION_FLAG_COMMIT  
> When this flag is set, all requirements for a commit have been met,
> i.e. all validation as well as the write_start and prepare transitions
> have been successful, and the actual commit will follow. This flag is
> only available in the `stop()` callback.

A variant of `confd_register_valpoint_cb()` which registers a validation
function for a range of key values. The `lower`, `upper`, `numkeys`,
`fmt`, and remaining parameters are the same as for
`confd_register_range_data_cb()`, see above.

    int confd_delayed_reply_validation_warn(
    struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx);

This function must be used to return the equivalent of
CONFD_VALIDATION_WARN when the `validate()` callback returned
CONFD_DELAYED_RESPONSE. Before calling this function, we must call
`confd_trans_seterr()` to provide a string describing the warning.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_PROTOUSAGE, CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

### Notification Streams

The application can generate notifications that are sent via the
northbound protocols. Currently NETCONF notification streams are
supported. The application generates the content for each notification
and sends it via a socket to ConfD, which in turn manages the stream
subscriptions and distributes the notifications accordingly.

A stream always has a "live feed", which is the sequence of new
notifications, sent in real time as they are generated. Subscribers may
also request "replay" of older, logged notifications if the stream
supports this, perhaps transitioning to the live feed when the end of
the log is reached. There may be one or more replays active
simultaneously with the live feed. ConfD forwards replay requests from
subscribers to the application via callbacks if the stream supports
replay.

Each notification has an associated time stamp, the "event time". This
is the time when the event that generated the notification occurred,
rather than the time the notification is logged or sent, in case these
times differ. The application must pass the event time to ConfD when
sending a notification, and it is also needed when replaying logged
events, see below.

    int confd_register_notification_stream(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, const struct confd_notification_stream_cbs *ncbs, 
    struct confd_notification_ctx **nctx);

This function registers the notification stream and optionally two
callback functions used for the replay functionality. If the stream does
not support replay, the callback elements in the
`struct confd_notification_stream_cbs` are set to NULL. A context
pointer is returned via the `**nctx` argument - this must be used by the
application for the sending of live notifications via
`confd_notification_send()` and `confd_notification_send_path()` (see
below).

The `confd_notification_stream_cbs` structure is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_notification_stream_cbs {
    char streamname[MAX_STREAMNAME_LEN];
    int fd;
    int (*get_log_times)(struct confd_notification_ctx *nctx);
    int (*replay)(struct confd_notification_ctx *nctx,
                  struct confd_datetime *start, struct confd_datetime *stop);
    void *cb_opaque; /* private user data */
};
```

</div>

The `fd` element must be set to a previously connected worker socket.
This socket may be used for multiple notification streams, but not for
any of the callback processing described above. Since it is only used
for sending data to ConfD, there is no need for the application to poll
the socket. Note that the control socket must be connected before
registration even if the callbacks are not registered.

> **Note**  
>  
> We must call the `confd_register_done()` function when we are done
> with all registrations for a daemon, see above.

The `get_log_times()` callback is called by ConfD to find out a) the
creation time of the current log and b) the event time of the last
notification aged out of the log, if any. The application provides the
times via the `confd_notification_reply_log_times()` function (see
below) and returns CONFD_OK.

The `replay()` callback is called by ConfD to request replay. The `nctx`
context pointer must be saved by the application and used when sending
the replay notifications via `confd_notification_send()` (or
`confd_notification_send_path()`), as well as for the
`confd_notification_replay_complete()` (or
`confd_notification_replay_failed()`) call (see below) - the callback
should return without waiting for the replay to complete. The pointer
references allocated memory, which is freed by the
`confd_notification_replay_complete()` (or
`confd_notification_replay_failed()`) call.

The times given by `*start` and `*stop` specify the extent of the
replay. The start time will always be given and specify a time in the
past, however the stop time may be either in the past or in the future
or even omitted, i.e. the `stop` argument is NULL. This means that the
subscriber has requested that the subscription continues indefinitely
with the live feed when the logged notifications have been sent.

If the stop time is given:

- The application sends all logged notifications that have an event time
  later than the start time but not later than the stop time, and then
  calls `confd_notification_replay_complete()`. Note that if the stop
  time is in the future when the replay request arrives, this includes
  notifications logged while the replay is in progress (if any), as long
  as their event time is not later than the stop time.

If the stop time is *not* given:

- The application sends all logged notifications that have an event time
  later than the start time, and then calls
  `confd_notification_replay_complete()`. Note that this includes
  notifications logged after the request was received (if any).

ConfD will if needed switch the subscriber over to the live feed and
then end the subscription when the stop time is reached. The callback
may analyze the `start` and `stop` arguments to determine start and stop
positions in the log, but if the analysis is postponed until after the
callback has returned, the `confd_datetime` structure(s) must be copied
by the callback.

The `replay()` callback may optionally select a separate worker socket
to be used for the replay notifications. In this case it must call
`confd_notification_set_fd()` to indicate which socket should be used.

Note that unlike the callbacks for external data bases and validation,
these callbacks do not use a worker socket for the callback processing,
and consequently there is no `init()` callback to request one. The
callbacks are invoked, and the reply is sent, via the daemon control
socket.

The `cb_opaque` element in the `confd_notification_stream_cbs` structure
can be used to pass arbitrary data to the callbacks in much the same way
as for callpoint and validation point registrations, see the description
of the `struct confd_data_cbs` structure above. However since the
callbacks are not associated with a transaction, this element is instead
made available in the `confd_notification_ctx` structure.

    int confd_notification_send(
    struct confd_notification_ctx *nctx, struct confd_datetime *time, confd_tag_value_t *values, 
    int nvalues);

This function is called by the application to send a notification,
defined at the top level of a YANG module, whether "live" or replay.

`confd_notification_send()` is asynchronous and a CONFD_OK return value
only states that the notification was successfully queued for delivery,
the actual send operation can still fail and such a failure will be
logged to ConfD's developerLog.

The `nctx` pointer is provided by ConfD as described above. The `time`
argument specifies the event time for the notification. The `values`
argument is an array of length `nvalues`, populated with the content of
the notification as described for the Tagged Value Array format in the
[XML STRUCTURES](section3.md#confd_types.xml_structures) section of the
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) manual page.

> **Note**  
>  
> The order of the tags in the array must be the same order as in the
> YANG model.

For example, with this definition at the top level of the YANG module
"test":

<div class="informalexample">

    notification linkUp {
      leaf ifIndex {
        type leafref {
          path "/interfaces/interface/ifIndex";
        }
        mandatory true;
      }
    }

</div>

a NETCONF notification of the form:

<div class="informalexample">

    <notification
     xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:notification:1.0">
      <eventTime>2007-08-17T08:56:05Z</eventTime>
      <linkUp xmlns="http://example.com/ns/test">
        <ifIndex>3</ifIndex>
      </linkUp>
    </notification>

</div>

could be sent with the following code:

<div class="informalexample">

    struct confd_notification_ctx *nctx;
    struct confd_datetime event_time = {2007, 8, 17, 8, 56, 5, 0, 0, 0};
    confd_tag_value_t notif[3];
    int n = 0;

    CONFD_SET_TAG_XMLBEGIN(&notif[n], test_linkUp, test__ns); n++;
    CONFD_SET_TAG_UINT32(&notif[n], test_ifIndex, 3); n++;
    CONFD_SET_TAG_XMLEND(&notif[n], test_linkUp, test__ns); n++;
    confd_notification_send(nctx, &event_time, notif, n);

</div>

    int confd_notification_send_path(
    struct confd_notification_ctx *nctx, struct confd_datetime *time, confd_tag_value_t *values, 
    int nvalues, const char *fmt, ...);

This function does the same as `confd_notification_send()`, but for the
"inline" notifications that are added in YANG 1.1, i.e. notifications
that are defined as a child of a container or list. The `nctx`, `time`,
`values`, and `nvalues` arguments are the same as for
`confd_notification_send()`, while the `fmt` and remaining arguments
specify a string path for the container or list entry that is the parent
of the notification, in the same form as for the
[confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi) and
[confd_lib_cdb(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_cdb) functions. Giving "/" for the
path is equivalent to calling `confd_notification_send()`.

> **Note**  
>  
> The path must be fully instantiated, i.e. all list nodes in the path
> must have all their keys specified.

For example, with this definition at the top level of the YANG module
"test":

<div class="informalexample">

    container interfaces {
      list interface {
        key ifIndex;
        leaf ifIndex {

</div>

    int confd_notification_replay_complete(
    struct confd_notification_ctx *nctx);

The application calls this function to notify ConfD that the replay is
complete, using the `nctx` pointer received in the corresponding
`replay()` callback invocation.

    int confd_notification_replay_failed(
    struct confd_notification_ctx *nctx);

In case the application fails to complete the replay as requested (e.g.
the log gets overwritten while the replay is in progress), the
application should call this function *instead* of
`confd_notification_replay_complete()`. An error message describing the
reason for the failure can be supplied by first calling
`confd_notification_seterr()` or `confd_notification_seterr_extended()`,
see below. The `nctx` pointer received in the corresponding `replay()`
callback invocation is used for both calls.

    void confd_notification_set_fd(
    struct confd_notification_ctx *nctx, int fd);

This function may optionally be called by the `replay()` callback to
request that the worker socket given by `fd` should be used for the
replay. Otherwise the socket specified in the
`confd_notification_stream_cbs` at registration will be used.

    int confd_notification_reply_log_times(
    struct confd_notification_ctx *nctx, struct confd_datetime *creation, 
    struct confd_datetime *aged);

Reply function for use in the `get_log_times()` callback invocation. If
no notifications have been aged out of the log, give NULL for the `aged`
argument.

    void confd_notification_seterr(
    struct confd_notification_ctx *nctx, const char *fmt);

In some cases the callbacks may be unable to carry out the requested
actions, e.g. the capacity for simultaneous replays might be exceeded,
and they can then return CONFD_ERR. This function allows the callback to
associate an error message with the failure. It can also be used to
supply an error message before calling
`confd_notification_replay_failed()`.

    void confd_notification_seterr_extended(
    struct confd_notification_ctx *nctx, enum confd_errcode code, uint32_t apptag_ns, 
    uint32_t apptag_tag, const char *fmt);

This function can be used to provide more structured error information
from a notification callback, see the section [EXTENDED ERROR
REPORTING](section3.md#confd_lib_lib.extended_error_reporting) in
[confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib).

    int confd_notification_seterr_extended_info(
    struct confd_notification_ctx *nctx, enum confd_errcode code, uint32_t apptag_ns, 
    uint32_t apptag_tag, confd_tag_value_t *error_info, int n, const char *fmt);

This function can be used to provide structured error information in the
same way as `confd_notification_seterr_extended()`, and additionally
provide contents for the NETCONF \<error-info\> element. See the section
[EXTENDED ERROR
REPORTING](section3.md#confd_lib_lib.extended_error_reporting) in
[confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib).

    int confd_register_snmp_notification(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, int fd, const char *notify_name, const char *ctx_name, 
    struct confd_notification_ctx **nctx);

SNMP notifications can also be sent via the notification framework,
however most aspects of the stream concept described above do not apply
for SNMP. This function is used to register a worker socket, the
snmpNotifyName (`notify_name`), and SNMP context (`ctx_name`) to be used
for the notifications.

The `fd` parameter must give a previously connected worker socket. This
socket may be used for different notifications, but not for any of the
callback processing described above. Since it is only used for sending
data to ConfD, there is no need for the application to poll the socket.
Note that the control socket must be connected before registration, even
if none of the callbacks described below are registered.

The context pointer returned via the `**nctx` argument must be used by
the application for the subsequent sending of the notifications via
`confd_notification_send_snmp()` or
`confd_notification_send_snmp_inform()` (see below).

When a notification is sent using one of these functions, it is
delivered to the management targets defined for the `snmpNotifyName` in
the `snmpNotifyTable` in SNMP-NOTIFICATION-MIB for the specified SNMP
context. If `notify_name` is NULL or the empty string (""), the
notification is sent to all management targets. If `ctx_name` is NULL or
the empty string (""), the default context ("") is used.

> **Note**  
>  
> We must call the `confd_register_done()` function when we are done
> with all registrations for a daemon, see above.

    int confd_notification_send_snmp(
    struct confd_notification_ctx *nctx, const char *notification, struct confd_snmp_varbind *varbinds, 
    int num_vars);

Sends the SNMP notification specified by `notification`, without
requesting inform-request delivery information. This is equivalent to
calling `confd_notification_send_snmp_inform()` (see below) with NULL as
the `cb_id` argument. I.e. if the common arguments are the same, the two
functions will send the exact same set of traps and inform-requests.

    int confd_register_notification_snmp_inform_cb(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, const struct confd_notification_snmp_inform_cbs *cb);

If we want to receive information about the delivery of SNMP
inform-requests, we must register two callbacks for this. The
`struct confd_notification_snmp_inform_cbs` is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_notification_snmp_inform_cbs {
    char cb_id[MAX_CALLPOINT_LEN];
    void (*targets)(struct confd_notification_ctx *nctx, int ref,
                    struct confd_snmp_target *targets, int num_targets);
    void (*result)(struct confd_notification_ctx *nctx, int ref,
                   struct confd_snmp_target *target, int got_response);
    void *cb_opaque; /* private user data */
};
```

</div>

The callback identifier `cb_id` can be chosen arbitrarily, it is only
used when sending SNMP notifications with
`confd_notification_send_snmp_inform()` - however each inform callback
registration must use a unique `cb_id`. The callbacks are invoked via
the control socket, i.e. the application must poll it and invoke
`confd_fd_ready()` when data is available.

When a notification is sent, the `target()` callback will be invoked
once with `num_targets` (possibly 0) inform-request targets in the
`targets` array, followed by `num_targets` invocations of the `result()`
callback, one for each target. The `ref` argument (passed from the
`confd_notification_send_snmp_inform()` call) allows for tracking the
result of multiple notifications with delivery overlap.

> **Note**  
>  
> We must call the `confd_register_done()` function when we are done
> with all registrations for a daemon, see above.

    int confd_notification_send_snmp_inform(
    struct confd_notification_ctx *nctx, const char *notification, struct confd_snmp_varbind *varbinds, 
    int num_vars, const char *cb_id, int ref);

Sends the SNMP notification specified by `notification`. If `cb_id` is
not NULL, the callbacks registered for `cb_id` will be invoked with the
`ref` argument as described above, otherwise no inform-request delivery
information will be provided. The `varbinds` array should be populated
with `num_vars` elements as described in the Notifications section of
the SNMP Agent chapter in the User Guide.

If `notification` is the empty string, no notification is looked up;
instead `varbinds` defines the notification, including the notification
id (variable name "snmpTrapOID"). This is especially useful for
forwarding a notification which has been received from the SNMP gateway
(see `confd_register_notification_sub_snmp_cb()` below).

If `varbinds` does not contain a timestamp (variable name "sysUpTime"),
one will be supplied by the agent.

    void confd_notification_set_snmp_src_addr(
    struct confd_notification_ctx *nctx, const struct confd_ip *src_addr);

By default, the source address for the SNMP notifications that are sent
by the above functions is chosen by the IP stack of the OS. This
function may be used to select a specific source address, given by
`src_addr`, for the SNMP notifications subsequently sent using the
`nctx` context. The default can be restored by calling the function with
a `src_addr` where the `af` element is set to `AF_UNSPEC`.

    int confd_notification_set_snmp_notify_name(
    struct confd_notification_ctx *nctx, const char *notify_name);

This function can be used to change the snmpNotifyName (`notify_name`)
for the `nctx` context. The new snmpNotifyName is used for notifications
sent by subsequent calls to `confd_notification_send_snmp()` and
`confd_notification_send_snmp_inform()` that use the `nctx` context.

    int confd_register_notification_sub_snmp_cb(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, const struct confd_notification_sub_snmp_cb *cb);

Registers a callback function to be called when an SNMP notification is
received by the SNMP gateway.

The `struct confd_notification_sub_snmp_cb` is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_notification_sub_snmp_cb {
    char sub_id[MAX_CALLPOINT_LEN];
    int (*recv)(struct confd_notification_ctx *nctx, char *notification,
                struct confd_snmp_varbind *varbinds, int num_vars,
                confd_value_t *src_addr, uint16_t src_port);
    void *cb_opaque; /* private user data */
};
```

</div>

The `sub_id` element is the subscription id for the notifications. The
`recv()` callback will be called when a notification is received. See
the section "Receiving and Forwarding Traps" in the chapter "The SNMP
gateway" in the Users Guide.

> **Note**  
>  
> We must call the `confd_register_done()` function when we are done
> with all registrations for a daemon, see above.

    int confd_notification_flush(
    struct confd_notification_ctx *nctx);

Notifications are sent asynchronously, i.e. normally without blocking
the caller of the send functions described above. This means that in
some cases, ConfD's sending of the notifications on the northbound
interfaces may lag behind the send calls. If we want to make sure that
the notifications have actually been sent out, e.g. in some shutdown
procedure, we can call `confd_notification_flush()`. This function will
block until all notifications sent using the given `nctx` context have
been fully processed by ConfD. It can be used both for notification
streams and for SNMP notifications (however it will not wait for replies
to SNMP inform-requests to arrive).

### Push On-Change Callbacks

The application can generate push notifications based on data changes
that are sent via the NETCONF protocol. The application generates
content for each subscription according to filters and other parameters
specified by the subscription callback and sends it via a socket to
ConfD. Push notifications that are received by ConfD are then published
to the NETCONF subscribers.

> [!WARNING]
> *Experimental*. The PUSH ON-CHANGE CALLBACKS are not subject to
> libconfd protocol version policy. Non-backwards compatible changes or
> removal may occur in any future release.

> **Note**  
>  
> ConfD implements a YANG-Push server and the push on-change callbacks
> provide a complementary mechanism for ConfD to publish updates from
> the data managed by data providers. Thus, it is recommended to be
> familiar with YANG-Push (RFC 8641) and YANG Patch (RFC 8072)
> standards.

    int confd_register_push_on_change(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, const struct confd_push_on_change_cbs *pcbs);

This function registers two mandatory callback functions used to
subscribe to and unsubscribe from on-change push notifications.

The `confd_push_on_change_cbs` structure is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_push_on_change_cbs {
    char callpoint[MAX_CALLPOINT_LEN];
    int fd;
    /*Yang-Push subscription on data changes*/
    int (*subscribe_on_change)(struct confd_push_on_change_ctx *pctx);
    /*Yang-Push unsubscription on data changes*/
    int (*unsubscribe_on_change)(struct confd_push_on_change_ctx *pctx);
    struct confd_push_on_change_ctx **push_ctxs;
    int push_ctxs_len, num_push_ctxs;
    void *cb_opaque; /* private user data */
};
```

</div>

The `fd` element must be set to a previously connected worker socket.
This socket may be used for multiple notification streams, but not for
any of the callback processing described above. Since it is only used
for sending data to ConfD, there is no need for the application to poll
the socket. Note that the control socket must be connected before
registration.

> **Note**  
>  
> We must call the `confd_register_done()` function when we are done
> with all registrations for a daemon, see above.

The `subscribe_on_change()` callback is called by ConfD to initiate a
subscription on specified data with specified trigger options passed by
the context pointer: `pctx` argument. The argument must be used by the
application for the sending of push notifications via
`confd_push_on_change()` (see below for details).

The `unsubscribe_on_change()` callback is called by ConfD to remove a
specified subscription by the context pointer `pctx` argument.

The `push_ctxs` is an array of contextual data that belongs to the
current subscriptions under the registered callback instance. The
`push_ctxs`, `push_ctxs_len` and `num_push_ctxs` are for internal use of
libconfd.

The `cb_opaque` element is reserved for future use.

The `struct confd_push_on_change_ctx` structure is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_push_on_change_ctx {
    char *callpoint;
    int fd;                      /* notification (worker) socket */
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx; /* our daemon ctx */
    struct confd_error error;    /* user settable via */
                                 /* confd_push_on_change_seterr*() */
    int subid;
    int usid;
    char *xpath_filter;
    confd_hkeypath_t *hkeypaths;
    int npaths;
    int dampening_period;
    int excluded_changes;
    void *cb_opaque; /* private user data from registration */

    /* ConfD internal fields */
    int flags;
};
```

</div>

The `subid` is the subscription identity provided by ConfD to identify
the subscription on NETCONF session.

The `usid` is the user id corresponding to the user of the NETCONF
session. The user id can be used to optionally identify and obtain the
user session, which can be used to authorize the push notifications.

> [!WARNING]
> ConfD will always check access rights on the data that is pushed from
> the applications, unless the configuration parameter
> `enableExternalAccessCheck` is set to *true*. If
> `enableExternalAccessCheck` is true and the application sets the
> `CONFD_PATCH_FLAG_AAA_CHECKED` flag, then ConfD will not perform
> access right checks on the received data.

The optional `xpath_filter` element is the string representation of the
XPath filter provided for the subscription to identify a portion of data
in the data tree. The `xpath_filter` is present if the NETCONF
subscription is specified with an XPath filter instead of a subtree
filter. Applications are requested to provide the data changes occurring
in the portion of the data where the XPath expression evaluates to.

The `hkeypaths` element is an array of `struct confd_hkeypath_t *`, each
path specifies the data sub-tree that the subscription is interested in
for occurring data changes. Applications are requested to provide the
data changes occurring at and under the data sub-tree pointed by the
provided hkeypaths. If an application is able to evaluate the XPath
expression specified by the `xpath_filter`, then it might not be needed
to take hkeypaths in consideration and the application may provide data
contents of the notifications according to the XPath evaluation it
performs. For the subscriptions with an XPath filter, hkeypaths are
populated in best effort manner and the data content of the
notifications might need to be filtered again by ConfD. The `hkeypaths`
must be used if `xpath_filter` is not provided.

The `npaths` integer specifies the size of the `hkeypaths` array.

The `dampening_period` element specifies the time interval that has to
pass before successive push notification can be sent. The
`dampening_period` is specified in centiseconds. Any notification that
is sent before the specified amount of time passed after previous
notification will be dampened by ConfD. Note that ConfD can dampen the
notification even if the application sends the successive notification
after the period ends. This can happen in cases where ConfD itself have
generated a notification for another portion of the data tree and pushed
it to the NETCONF session.

The `excluded_changes` is an integer specifying which kind of changes
should not be included in push notifications. The application needs to
check which bits in the `excluded_changes` are set and compare it with
the enumerated change codes below, defined by `enum confd_data_op`.

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
enum confd_data_op {
    CONFD_DATA_CREATE = 0,
    CONFD_DATA_DELETE = 1,
    CONFD_DATA_INSERT = 2,
    CONFD_DATA_MERGE = 3,
    CONFD_DATA_MOVE = 4,
    CONFD_DATA_REPLACE = 5,
    CONFD_DATA_REMOVE = 6
};
```

</div>

    int confd_push_on_change(
    struct confd_push_on_change_ctx *pctx, struct confd_datetime *time, const struct confd_data_patch *patch);

This function is called by the application to send a push notification
upon data changes occurring in the subscribed portion of the data tree.
`confd_push_on_change()` is asynchronous and a CONFD_OK return value
only states that the notification was successfully passed to ConfD. The
actual NETCONF notification might differ according to the ConfD
configuration and its state.

The `pctx` pointer is provided by ConfD as it is described above. The
`time` argument specifies the event time for the notification. The
`patch` argument of type `struct confd_data_patch*` is populated with
the content of the push notification as described below. The structure
of the `struct confd_data_patch*` conforms to YANG Patch media type
specified by RFC 8072.

The `struct confd_data_patch` structure is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_data_patch {
    char *patch_id;
    char *comment;
    struct confd_data_edit *edits;
    int nedits;
    int flags;
};
```

</div>

The application must set `patch_id` to a string for identification of
the patch. The application should attempt to generate unique values to
distinguish between transactions from multiple clients in any audit logs
maintained by ConfD. The `patch_id` string is not used by ConfD when
publishing push change update notifications via NETCONF, but it may be
used for auditing in the future.

The application can optionally set `comment` to a string to describe the
patch.

The `edits` is an array of `struct confd_data_edit*` type, which also
conforms to the edit list in YANG Patch specified by RFC 8072. Each edit
instance represents one type of change on targeted portions of
datastore. (See below for detailed description of the
`struct confd_data_edit*`).

The application must set the `nedits` integer value according to the
number of edits populated in the `edits` array.

The application must set the `flags` integer value by setting the bits
corresponding to the below macros and their conditions.

<div class="informalexample">

    CONFD_PATCH_FLAG_INCOMPLETE      /* indicates that not all subscribed
                                        datastore nodes are included with this

                                        after current dampening period ends. */
    CONFD_PATCH_FLAG_FILTER          /* indicates that ConfD should filter the

    CONFD_PATCH_FLAG_AAA_CHECKED     /* indicates that the application already

</div>

> [!WARNING]
> Currently ConfD can not apply an XPath or Subtree filter on the data

The `struct confd_data_edit` structure is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_data_edit {
    char *edit_id;
    enum confd_data_op op;
    void *target;
    void *point;
    enum confd_data_where where;
    confd_tag_value_t *data;
    int ndata;
    int flags;
    int (*set_path)(const struct confd_data_edit *edit, size_t offset,
                    const char *fmt, ...);
};
```

</div>

An edit may be defined as in the example below and the struct member
values can be initialized using `CONFD_DATA_EDIT()` macro.

<div class="informalexample">

    struct confd_data_edit *edit =
        (struct confd_data_edit *) malloc(sizeof(struct confd_data_edit));
    *edit = CONFD_DATA_EDIT();

</div>

The application must set an arbitrary string to `edit_id` as an
identifier for the edit.

The mandatory `op` element of type `enum confd_data_op` must be set to
one of the enumerated values. (See above for the definition).

The mandatory `target` element identifies the target data node for the
edit. The `target` can be set using the convenience macro
`CONFD_DATA_EDIT_SET_PATH`, where a `fmt` argument and variable
arguments can be passed to set the path to target.

<div class="informalexample">

    CONFD_DATA_EDIT_SET_PATH(edit, target, "/if:interfaces/interface{eth%d}", 1);

</div>

The conditional `point` element identifies the position of the data node
when the value of `op` is `CONFD_DATA_INSERT` or `CONFD_DATA_MOVE`; and
also the value of `where` is `CONFD_DATA_BEFORE` or `CONFD_DATA_AFTER`.
The `point` can be set using the convenience macro
`CONFD_DATA_EDIT_SET_PATH`, similar to the `target` element.

<div class="informalexample">

    CONFD_DATA_EDIT_SET_PATH(edit, point, "/if:interfaces/interface{eth%d}", 0);

</div>

The conditional `where` element of type `enum confd_data_where`
identifies the relative position of the data node when the value of `op`
is `CONFD_DATA_INSERT` or `CONFD_DATA_MOVE`. The `enum confd_data_where`
is defined as below.

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
enum confd_data_where {
    CONFD_DATA_BEFORE = 0,
    CONFD_DATA_AFTER = 1,
    CONFD_DATA_FIRST = 2,
    CONFD_DATA_LAST = 3
};
```

</div>

The conditional `data` element is an array of type
`struct confd_tag_value_t*` and must be populated when the edit's `op`
value is `CONFD_DATA_CREATE`, `CONFD_DATA_MERGE`, `CONFD_DATA_REPLACE`,
or `CONFD_DATA_INSERT`. The data array is populated with values
according to the specification of the Tagged Value Array format in the
[XML STRUCTURES](section3.md#confd_types.xml_structures) section of the
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) manual page.

> **Note**  
>  
> The order of the tags in the array must be the same order as in the
> YANG model.

The conditional `ndata` must be set to an integer value if `data` is
set, according to the number of `struct confd_tag_value_t` instances
populated in `data` array.

The `flags` element is reserved for future use.

The `set_path` function pointer is for internal use. It provides a
convenience function for setting `target` and `point` elements of type
void pointers.

Example: a NETCONF YANG-Push notification of the form:

<div class="informalexample">

    <notification
      xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:notification:1.0">
      <eventTime>2020-11-10T08:56:05.0+00.00</eventTime>

### Confd Actions

The use of action callbacks can be specified either via a `rpc`
statement or via a `tailf:action` statement in the YANG data model, see
the YANG specification and
[tailf_yang_extensions(5)](section5.md#tailf_yang_extensions). In both cases
the use of a `tailf:actionpoint` statement specifies that the action is
implemented as a callback function. This section describes how such
callback functions should be implemented and registered with ConfD.

Unlike the callbacks for data and validation, there is not always a
transaction associated with an action callback. However an action is
always associated with a user session (NETCONF, CLI, etc), and only one
action at a time can be invoked from a given user session. Hence a
pointer to the associated `struct confd_user_info` is passed to the
callbacks.

The action callback mechanism is also used for command and completion
callbacks configured for the CLI, either in a YANG module using tailf
extension statements, or in a [clispec(5)](section5.md#clispec). As the
parameter structure is significantly different, special callbacks are
used for these functions.

    int confd_register_action_cbs(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, const struct confd_action_cbs *acb);

This function registers up to five callback functions, two of which will
be called in sequence when an action is invoked. The
`struct confd_action_cbs` is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_action_cbs {
    char actionpoint[MAX_CALLPOINT_LEN];
    int (*init)(struct confd_user_info *uinfo);
    int (*abort)(struct confd_user_info *uinfo);
    int (*action)(struct confd_user_info *uinfo, struct xml_tag *name,
                  confd_hkeypath_t *kp, confd_tag_value_t *params, int nparams);
    int (*command)(struct confd_user_info *uinfo, char *path, int argc,
                   char **argv);
    int (*completion)(struct confd_user_info *uinfo, int cli_style, char *token,
                      int completion_char, confd_hkeypath_t *kp, char *cmdpath,
                      char *cmdparam_id, struct confd_qname *simpleType,
                      char *extra);
    void *cb_opaque; /* private user data */
};
```

</div>

The `init()` callback, and at least one of the `action()`, `command()`,
and `completion()` callbacks, must be specified. It is in principle
possible to use a single "point name" for more than one of these
callback types, and have the corresponding callback invoked in each
case, but in typical usage we would only register one of the callbacks
`action()`, `command()`, and `completion()`. Below, the term "action
callback" is used to refer to any of these three.

Similar to the `init()` callback for external data bases, we must in the
`init()` callback associate a worker socket with the action. This socket
will be used for the invocation of the action callback, which actually
carries out the action. Thus in a multi threaded application, actions
can be dispatched to different threads.

However note that unlike the callbacks for external data bases and
validation, both `init()` and action callbacks are registered for each
action point (i.e. different action points can have different `init()`
callbacks), and there is no `finish()` callback - the action is
completed when the action callback returns.

The `struct confd_action_ctx actx` element inside the
`struct confd_user_info` holds action-specific data, in particular the
`t_opaque` element could be used to pass data from the `init()` callback
to the action callback, if needed. If the action is associated with a
transaction, the `thandle` element is set to the transaction handle, and
can be used with a call to `maapi_attach2()` (see
[confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi)), otherwise `thandle` will
be -1. It is up to the northbound interface whether to invoke the action
with a transaction handle, and the action implementer must check if the
thandle is -1 or a proper transaction handle if the action intends to
use it. The CLI will always invoke an action with a transaction handle
(it will pass a handle to a read_write transaction when in configure
mode, and a read transaction otherwise). The NETCONF interface will do
so if the tailf extension `<start-transaction/>` was used before the
action was invoked. A transaction handle will also be passed to the
callback when invoked via `maapi_request_action_th()` (see
[confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi)).

The `cb_opaque` element in the `confd_action_cbs` structure can be used
to pass arbitrary data to the callbacks in much the same way as for
callpoint and validation point registrations, see the description of the
`struct confd_data_cbs` structure above. This element is made available
in the `confd_action_ctx` structure.

If the `tailf:opaque` substatement has been used with the
`tailf:actionpoint` statement in the data model, the argument string is
made available to the callbacks via the `actionpoint_opaque` element in
the `confd_action_ctx` structure.

> **Note**  
>  
> We must call the `confd_register_done()` function when we are done
> with all registrations for a daemon, see above.

The `action()` callback receives all the parameters pertaining to the
action: The `name` argument is a pointer to the action name as defined
in the data model, the `kp` argument gives the path through the data
model for an action defined via `tailf:action` (it is a NULL pointer for
an action defined via `rpc`), and finally the `params` argument is a
representation of the inout parameters provided when the action is
invoked. The `params` argument is an array of length `nparams`,
populated as described for the Tagged Value Array format in the [XML
STRUCTURES](section3.md#confd_types.xml_structures) section of the
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) manual page.

The `command()` callback is invoked for CLI callback commands. It must
always result in a call of `confd_action_reply_command()`. As the
parameters in this case are all in string form, they are passed in the
traditional Unix `argc`, `argv` manner - i.e. `argv` is an array of
`argc` pointers to NUL-terminated strings plus a final NULL pointer
element, and `argv[0]` is the name of the command. Additionally the full
path of the command is available via the `path` argument.

The `completion()` callback is invoked for CLI completion and
information. It must result in a call of
`confd_action_reply_completion()`, except for the case when the callback
is invoked via a `tailf:cli-custom-range-enumerator` statement in the
data model (see below). The `cli_style` argument gives the style of the
CLI session as a character: 'J', 'C', or 'I'. The `token` argument is a
NUL-terminated string giving the parameter of the CLI command line that
the callback invocation pertains to, and `completion_char` is the
character that the user typed, i.e. TAB ('\t'), SPACE (' '), or '?'. If
the callback pertains to a data model element, `kp` identifies that
element, otherwise it is NULL. The `cmdpath` is a NUL-terminated string
giving the full path of the command. If a `cli-completion-id` is
specified in the YANG module, or a `completionId` is specified in the
clispec, it is given as a NUL-terminated string via `cmdparam_id`,
otherwise this argument is NULL. If the invocation pertains to an
element that has a type definition, the `simpleType` argument identifies
the type with namespace and type name, otherwise it is NULL. The `extra`
argument is currently unused (always NULL).

When `completion()` is invoked via a `tailf:cli-custom-range-enumerator`
statement in the data model, it is a request to provide possible key
values for creation of an entry in a list with a custom range
specification. The callback must in this case result in a call of
`confd_action_reply_range_enum()`. Refer to the `cli/range_create`
example in the bundled examples collection to see an implementation of
such a callback.

The action callbacks must return CONFD_OK, CONFD_ERR, or
CONFD_DELAYED_RESPONSE. CONFD_DELAYED_RESPONSE implies that the
application must later reply asynchronously.

The optional `abort()` callback is called whenever an action is aborted,
e.g. when a user invokes an action from one of the northbound agents and
aborts it before it has completed. The `abort()` callback will be
invoked on the control socket. It is the responsibility of the `abort()`
callback to make sure that the pending reply from the action callback is
sent. This is required to allow the worker socket to be used for further
queries. There are several possible ways for an application to support
aborting. E.g. the application can return CONFD_DELAYED_RESPONSE from
the action callback. Then, when the `abort()` callback is called, it can
terminate the executing action and use e.g.
`confd_action_delayed_reply_error()`. Alternatively an application can
use threads where the action callback is executed in a separate thread.
In this case the `abort()` callback could inform the thread executing
the action that it should be terminated, and that thread can just return
from the action callback.

    int confd_register_range_action_cbs(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, const struct confd_action_cbs *acb, const confd_value_t *lower, 
    const confd_value_t *upper, int numkeys, const char *fmt, ...);

A variant of `confd_register_action_cbs()` which registers action
callbacks for a range of key values. The `lower`, `upper`, `numkeys`,
`fmt`, and remaining parameters are the same as for
`confd_register_range_data_cb()`, see above.

> **Note**  
>  
> This function can not be used for registration of the `command()` or
> `completion()` callbacks - only actions specified in the data model

> corresponding callbacks.

    void confd_action_set_fd(
    struct confd_user_info *uinfo, int sock);

Associate a worker socket with the action. This function must be called
in the `init()` callback - a typical implementation of an `init()`
callback looks as:

<div class="informalexample">

    static int init_action(struct confd_user_info *uinfo)
    {
        confd_action_set_fd(uinfo, workersock);
        return CONFD_OK;
    }

</div>

    int confd_action_reply_values(
    struct confd_user_info *uinfo, confd_tag_value_t *values, int nvalues);

If the action definition specifies that the action should return data,
it must invoke this function in response to the `action()` callback. The
`values` argument points to an array of length `nvalues`, populated with
the output parameters in the same way as the `params` array above.

> **Note**  
>  
> This function must only be called for an `action()` callback.

    int confd_action_reply_command(
    struct confd_user_info *uinfo, char **values, int nvalues);

If a CLI callback command should return data, it must invoke this
function in response to the `command()` callback. The `values` argument
points to an array of length `nvalues`, populated with pointers to
NUL-terminated strings.

> **Note**  
>  
> This function must only be called for a `command()` callback.

    int confd_action_reply_rewrite(
    struct confd_user_info *uinfo, char **values, int nvalues, char **unhides, 
    int nunhides);

This function can be called instead of `confd_action_reply_command()` as
a response to a show path rewrite callback invocation. The `values`
argument points to an array of length `nvalues`, populated with pointers
to NUL-terminated strings representing the tokens of the new path. The
`unhides` argument points to an array of length `nunhides`, populated
with pointers to NUL-terminated strings representing hide groups to
temporarily unhide during evaluation of the show command.

> **Note**  
>  
> This function must only be called for a `command()` callback.

    int confd_action_reply_rewrite2(
    struct confd_user_info *uinfo, char **values, int nvalues, char **unhides, 
    int nunhides, struct confd_rewrite_select **selects, int nselects);

This function can be called instead of `confd_action_reply_command()` as
a response to a show path rewrite callback invocation. The `values`
argument points to an array of length `nvalues`, populated with pointers
to NUL-terminated strings representing the tokens of the new path. The
`unhides` argument points to an array of length `nunhides`, populated
with pointers to NUL-terminated strings representing hide groups to
temporarily unhide during evaluation of the show command. The `selects`
argument points to an array of length `nselects`, populated with
pointers to confd_rewrite_select structs representing additional select
targets.

> **Note**  
>  
> This function must only be called for a `command()` callback.

    int confd_action_reply_completion(
    struct confd_user_info *uinfo, struct confd_completion_value *values, 
    int nvalues);

This function must normally be called in response to the `completion()`
callback. The `values` argument points to an `nvalues` long array of
`confd_completion_value` elements:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
enum confd_completion_type {
    CONFD_COMPLETION,
    CONFD_COMPLETION_INFO,
    CONFD_COMPLETION_DESC,
    CONFD_COMPLETION_DEFAULT
};
```

``` c
struct confd_completion_value {
    enum confd_completion_type type;
    char *value;
    char *extra;
};

</div>

For a completion alternative, `type` is set to CONFD_COMPLETION, `value`
gives the alternative as a NUL-terminated string, and `extra` gives
explanatory text as a NUL-terminated string - if there is no such text,
`extra` is set to NULL. For "info" or "desc" elements, `type` is set to
CONFD_COMPLETION_INFO or CONFD_COMPLETION_DESC, respectively, and
`value` gives the text as a NUL-terminated string (the `extra` element
is ignored).

In order to fallback to the normal completion behavior, `type` should be
set to CONFD_COMPLETION_DEFAULT. CONFD_COMPLETION_DEFAULT cannot be
combined with the other completion types, implying the `values` array
always must have length `1` which is indicated by `nvalues` setting.

> **Note**  
>  
> This function must only be called for a `completion()` callback.

    int confd_action_reply_range_enum(
    struct confd_user_info *uinfo, char **values, int keysize, int nkeys);

This function must be called in response to the `completion()` callback
when it is invoked via a `tailf:cli-custom-range-enumerator` statement
in the data model. The `values` argument points to a `keysize` `*`
`nkeys` long array of strings giving the possible key values, where
`keysize` is the number of keys for the list in the data model and
`nkeys` is the number of list entries for which keys are provided. I.e.
the array gives entry1-key1, entry1-key2, ..., entry2-key1, entry2-key2,
... and so on. See the `cli/range_create` example in the bundled
examples collection for details.

> **Note**  
>  
> This function must only be called for a `completion()` callback.

    void confd_action_seterr(
    struct confd_user_info *uinfo, const char *fmt);

If action callback encounters fatal problems that can not be expressed
via the reply function, it may call this function with an appropriate
message and return CONFD_ERR instead of CONFD_OK.

    void confd_action_seterr_extended(
    struct confd_user_info *uinfo, enum confd_errcode code, uint32_t apptag_ns, 
    uint32_t apptag_tag, const char *fmt);

This function can be used to provide more structured error information
from an action callback, see the section [EXTENDED ERROR
REPORTING](section3.md#confd_lib_lib.extended_error_reporting) in
[confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib).

    int confd_action_seterr_extended_info(
    struct confd_user_info *uinfo, enum confd_errcode code, uint32_t apptag_ns, 
    uint32_t apptag_tag, confd_tag_value_t *error_info, int n, const char *fmt);

This function can be used to provide structured error information in the
same way as `confd_action_seterr_extended()`, and additionally provide
contents for the NETCONF \<error-info\> element. See the section
[EXTENDED ERROR
REPORTING](section3.md#confd_lib_lib.extended_error_reporting) in
[confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib).

    int confd_action_delayed_reply_ok(
    struct confd_user_info *uinfo);

    int confd_action_delayed_reply_error(
    struct confd_user_info *uinfo, const char *errstr);

If we use the CONFD_DELAYED_RESPONSE as a return value from the action
callback, we must later asynchronously reply. If we use one of the
`confd_action_reply_xxx()` functions, this is a complete reply.
Otherwise we must use the `confd_action_delayed_reply_ok()` function to
signal success, or the `confd_action_delayed_reply_error()` function to
signal an error.

    int confd_action_set_timeout(
    struct confd_user_info *uinfo, int timeout_secs);

Some action callbacks may require a significantly longer execution time
than others, and this time may not even be possible to determine
statically (e.g. a file download). In such cases the
/confdConfig/capi/queryTimeout setting in `confd.conf` (see above) may
be insufficient, and this function can be used to extend (or shorten)
the timeout for the current callback invocation. The timeout is given in
seconds from the point in time when the function is called.

Examples on how to work with actions are available in the User Guide and
in the bundled examples collection.

### Authentication Callback

We can register a callback with ConfD's AAA subsystem, to be invoked
whenever AAA has completed processing of an authentication attempt. In
the case where the authentication was otherwise successful, the callback
can still cause it to be rejected. This can be used to implement
specific access policies, as an alternative to using PAM or "External"
authentication for this purpose. The callback will only be invoked if it
is both enabled via /confdConfig/aaa/authenticationCallback/enabled in
`confd.conf` (see [confd.conf(5)](section5.md#ncs.conf)) and registered as
described here.

> **Note**  
>  
> If the callback is enabled in `confd.conf` but not registered, or
> invocation keeps failing for some reason, *all* authentication
> attempts will fail.

> **Note**  
>  
> This callback can not be used to actually *perform* the
> authentication. If we want to implement the authentication outside of
> ConfD, we need to use PAM or "External" authentication, see the AAA
> chapter in the Admin Guide.

    int confd_register_auth_cb(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, const struct confd_auth_cb *acb);

Registers the authentication callback. The `struct confd_auth_cb` is
defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_auth_cb {
    int (*auth)(struct confd_auth_ctx *actx);
};
```

</div>

The `auth()` callback is invoked with a pointer to an authentication
context that provides information about the result of the authentication
so far. The callback must return CONFD_OK or CONFD_ERR, see below. The
`struct confd_auth_ctx` is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_auth_ctx {
    struct confd_user_info *uinfo;
    char *method;
    int success;
    union {
        struct { /* if success */
            int ngroups;
            char **groups;
        } succ;
        struct {       /* if !success */
            int logno; /* number from confd_logsyms.h */
            char *reason;
        } fail;
    } ainfo;
    /* ConfD internal fields */
    char *errstr;
};
```

</div>

The `uinfo` element points to a `struct confd_user_info` with details
about the user logging in, specifically user name, password (if used),
source IP address, context, and protocol. Note that the user session
does not actually exist at this point, even if the AAA authentication
was successful - it will only be created if the callback accepts the
authentication, hence e.g. the `usid` element is always 0.

The `method` string gives the authentication method used, as follows:

"password"  
> Password authentication. This generic term is used if the
> authentication failed.

"local", "pam", "external"  
> Password authentication. On successful authentication, the specific
> method that succeeded is given. See the AAA chapter in the Admin Guide
> for an explanation of these methods.

"publickey"  
> Public key authentication via the internal SSH server.

Other  
> Authentication with an unknown or unsupported method with this name
> was attempted via the internal SSH server.

If `success` is non-zero, the AAA authentication succeeded, and `groups`
is an array of length `ngroups` that gives the groups that will be
assigned to the user at login. If the callback returns CONFD_OK, the
complete authentication succeeds and the user is logged in. If it
returns CONFD_ERR (or an invalid return value), the authentication
fails.

If `success` is zero, the AAA authentication failed (with `logno` set to
`CONFD_AUTH_LOGIN_FAIL`), and the explanatory string `reason`. This
invocation is only for informational purposes - the callback return
value has no effect on the authentication, and should normally be
CONFD_OK.

    void confd_auth_seterr(
    struct confd_auth_ctx *actx, const char *fmt, ...);

This function can be used to provide a text message when the callback
returns CONFD_ERR. If used when rejecting a successful authentication,
the message will be logged in ConfD's audit log (otherwise a generic
"rejected by application callback" message is logged).

### Authorization Callbacks

We can register two authorization callbacks with ConfD's AAA subsystem.
These will be invoked when the northbound agents check that a command or
a data access is allowed by the AAA access rules. The callbacks can
partially or completely replace the access checks done within the AAA
subsystem, and they may accept or reject the access. Typically many
access checks are done during the processing of commands etc, and using
these callbacks can thus have a significant performance impact. Unless
it is a requirement to query an external authorization mechanism, it is
far better to only configure access rules in the AAA data model (see the
AAA chapter in the Admin Guide).

The callbacks will only be invoked if they are both enabled via
/confdConfig/aaa/authorization/callback/enabled in `confd.conf` (see
[confd.conf(5)](section5.md#ncs.conf)) and registered as described here.

> **Note**  
>  
> If the callbacks are enabled in `confd.conf` but no registration has
> been done, or if invocation keeps failing for some reason, *all*
> access checks will be rejected.

    int confd_register_authorization_cb(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, const struct confd_authorization_cbs *acb);

Registers the authorization callbacks. The
`struct confd_authorization_cbs` is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_authorization_cbs {
    int cmd_filter;
    int data_filter;
    int (*chk_cmd_access)(struct confd_authorization_ctx *actx,
                          char **cmdtokens, int ntokens, int cmdop);
    int (*chk_data_access)(struct confd_authorization_ctx *actx,
                           uint32_t hashed_ns, confd_hkeypath_t *hkp,
                           int dataop, int how);
};
```

</div>

Both callbacks are optional, i.e. we can set the function pointer in
`struct confd_authorization_cbs` to NULL if we don't want the
corresponding callback invocation. In this case the AAA subsystem will
handle the access check as if the callback was registered, but always
replied with `CONFD_ACCESS_RESULT_DEFAULT` (see below).

The `cmd_filter` and `data_filter` elements can be used to prevent
access checks from causing invocation of a callback even though it is
registered. If we do not want any filtering, they must be set to zero.
The value is a bitmask obtained by ORing together values: For
`cmd_filter`, we can use the possible values for `cmdop` (see below),
preventing the corresponding invocations of `chk_cmd_access()`. For
`data_filter`, we can use the possible values for `dataop` and `how`
(see below), preventing the corresponding invocation of
`chk_data_access()`. If the callback invocation is prevented by
filtering, the AAA subsystem will handle the access check as if the
callback had replied with `CONFD_ACCESS_RESULT_CONTINUE` (see below).

Both callbacks are invoked with a pointer to an authorization context
that provides information about the user session that the access check
pertains to, and the group list for that session. The
`struct confd_authorization_ctx` is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_authorization_ctx {
    struct confd_user_info *uinfo;
    int ngroups;
    char **groups;
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx;
    /* ConfD internal fields */
    int result;
    int query_ref;
};
```

</div>

`chk_cmd_access()`  
> This callback is invoked for command authorization, i.e. it
> corresponds to the rules under /aaa/authorization/cmdrules in the AAA
> data model. `cmdtokens` is an array of `ntokens` NUL-terminated

<!-- -->

    int confd_access_reply_result(
    struct confd_authorization_ctx *actx, int result);

The callbacks must call this function to report the result of the access
check to ConfD, and should normally return CONFD_OK. If any other value
is returned, it will cause the access check to be rejected. The `actx`
parameter is the pointer to the authorization context passed in the
callback invocation, and `result` must be one of:

`CONFD_ACCESS_RESULT_ACCEPT`  
> The access is allowed. This is a "final verdict", analogous to a "full
> match" when the AAA rules are used.

`CONFD_ACCESS_RESULT_REJECT`  
> The access is denied.

`CONFD_ACCESS_RESULT_CONTINUE`  
> The access is allowed "so far". I.e. access to sub-elements is not
> necessarily allowed. This result is mainly useful when
> `chk_cmd_access()` is called with `cmdop` == `CONFD_ACCESS_OP_READ` or
> `chk_data_access()` is called with `how` ==
> `CONFD_ACCESS_CHK_INTERMEDIATE`.

`CONFD_ACCESS_RESULT_DEFAULT`  
> The request should be handled according to the rules configured in the
> AAA data model.

<!-- -->

    int confd_authorization_set_timeout(
    struct confd_authorization_ctx *actx, int timeout_secs);

The authorization callbacks are invoked on the daemon control socket,
and as such are expected to complete quickly, within the timeout
specified for /confdConfig/capi/newSessionTimeout. However in case they
send requests to a remote server, and such a request needs to be
retried, this function can be used to extend the timeout for the current
callback invocation. The timeout is given in seconds from the point in
time when the function is called.

### Error Formatting Callback

It is possible to register a callback function to generate customized
error messages for ConfD's internally generated errors. All the
customizable errors are defined with a type and a code in the XML
document `$CONFD_DIR/src/confd/errors/errcode.xml` in the ConfD release.
To use this functionality, the application must `#include` the file
`confd_errcode.h`, which defines C constants for the types and codes.

    int confd_register_error_cb(
    struct confd_daemon_ctx *dx, const struct confd_error_cb *ecb);

Registers the error formatting callback. The `struct confd_error_cb` is
defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_error_cb {
    int error_types;
    void (*format_error)(struct confd_user_info *uinfo,
                         struct confd_errinfo *errinfo, char *default_msg);
};
```

</div>

The `error_types` element is the logical OR of the error types that the
callback should handle. An application daemon can only register one
error formatting callback, and only one daemon can register for each
error type. The available types are:

`CONFD_ERRTYPE_VALIDATION`  
> Errors detected by ConfD's internal semantic validation of the data
> model constraints, e.g. mandatory elements that are unset, dangling
> references, etc. The codes for this type are the `confd_errno` values
> corresponding to the validation errors, as resulting e.g. from a call
> to `maapi_apply_trans()` (see
> [confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi)). I.e. CONFD_ERR_NOTSET,
> CONFD_ERR_BAD_KEYREF, etc - see the 'id' attribute in `errcode.xml`.

`CONFD_ERRTYPE_BAD_VALUE`  
> Type errors, i.e. errors generated when an invalid value is given for
> a leaf in the data model. The codes for this type are defined in
> `confd_errcode.h` as CONFD_BAD_VALUE_XXX, where "XXX" is the
> all-uppercase form of the code name given in `errcode.xml`.

`CONFD_ERRTYPE_CLI`  
> CLI-specific errors. The codes for this type are defined in
> `confd_errcode.h` as CONFD_CLI_XXX in the same way as for
> `CONFD_ERRTYPE_BAD_VALUE`.

`CONFD_ERRTYPE_MISC`  
> Miscellaneous errors, which do not fit into the other categories. The
> codes for this type are defined in `confd_errcode.h` as CONFD_MISC_XXX
> in the same way as for `CONFD_ERRTYPE_BAD_VALUE`.

`CONFD_ERRTYPE_NCS`  
> NCS errors, which is a broad class of errors, ranging from
> authentication failures towards devices to case errors. The codes for
> this type are defined in `confd_errcode.h` as CONFD_NCS_XXX in the
> same way as for `CONFD_ERRTYPE_BAD_VALUE`.

`CONFD_ERRTYPE_OPERATION`  
> The same set of errors and codes as for `CONFD_ERRTYPE_VALIDATION`,
> but detected in validation of input parameters for an rpc or action.

The `format_error()` callback is invoked with a pointer to a
`struct confd_errinfo`, which gives the error type and type-specific
structured information about the details of the error. It is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_errinfo {
    int type;  /* CONFD_ERRTYPE_XXX */
    union {
        struct confd_errinfo_validation validation;
        struct confd_errinfo_bad_value bad_value;
        struct confd_errinfo_cli cli;
        struct confd_errinfo_misc misc;
#ifdef CONFD_C_PRODUCT_NCS
        struct confd_errinfo_ncs ncs;
#endif
    } info;
};
```

</div>

For `CONFD_ERRTYPE_VALIDATION` and `CONFD_ERRTYPE_OPERATION`, the
`struct confd_errinfo_validation validation` gives the detailed
information, using an `info` union that has a specific struct member for
each code:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_errinfo_validation {
    int code;  /* CONFD_ERR_NOTSET, CONFD_ERR_TOO_FEW_ELEMS, ... */
    union {
        struct {
            /* the element given by kp is not set */
            confd_hkeypath_t *kp;
        } notset;
        struct {
            /* kp has n instances, must be at least min */
            confd_hkeypath_t *kp;
            int n, min;
        } too_few_elems;
        struct {
            /* kp has n instances, must be at most max */
            confd_hkeypath_t *kp;
            int n, max;
        } too_many_elems;
        struct {
            /* the elements given by kps1 have the same set
               of values vals as the elements given by kps2
               (kps1, kps2, and vals point to n_elems long arrays) */
            int n_elems;
            confd_hkeypath_t *kps1;
            confd_hkeypath_t *kps2;
            confd_value_t *vals;
        } non_unique;
        struct {
            /* the element given by kp references
               the non-existing element given by ref
               Note: 'ref' may be NULL or have key elements without values
               (ref->v[n][0].type == C_NOEXISTS) if it cannot be instantiated */
            confd_hkeypath_t *kp;
            confd_hkeypath_t *ref;
        } bad_keyref;
        struct {
            /* the mandatory 'choice' statement choice in the
               container kp does not have a selected 'case' */
            confd_value_t *choice;
            confd_hkeypath_t *kp;
        } unset_choice;
        struct {
            /* the 'must' expression expr for element kp is not satisfied

               has one, otherwise it is NULL */
            char *expr;
            confd_hkeypath_t *kp;
            char *error_message;
            char *error_app_tag;
            confd_value_t *val;
        } must_failed;
        struct {
            /* the element kp has the instance-identifier value instance,
               which doesn't exist, but require-instance is 'true' */
            confd_hkeypath_t *kp;
            confd_hkeypath_t *instance;
        } missing_instance;
        struct {
            /* the element kp has the instance-identifier value instance,
               which doesn't conform to the specified path filters */
            confd_hkeypath_t *kp;
            confd_hkeypath_t *instance;
        } invalid_instance;
        struct {
            /* the element kp has the instance-identifier value instance,
               which has stale data after upgrading, and require-instance
               is 'true' */
            confd_hkeypath_t *kp;
            confd_hkeypath_t *instance;
        } stale_instance;
        struct {
            /* the expression for a configuration policy rule evaluated to
               'false' - error_message is the associated error message */
            char *error_message;
        } policy_failed;
        struct {
            /* the XPath expression expr, for the configuration policy
               rule with key name, could not be compiled due to msg */
            char *name;
            char *expr;
            char *msg;
        } policy_compilation_failed;
        struct {
            /* the expression expr, for the configuration policy rule
               with key name, failed XPath evaluation due to msg */
            char *name;
            char *expr;
            char *msg;
        } policy_evaluation_failed;
    } info;
    /* These are only provided for CONFD_ERRTYPE_VALIDATION */
    int test;            /* 1 if 'validate', 0 if 'commit' */
    struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx; /* only valid for duration of callback */
};
```

</div>

The member structs are named as the `confd_errno` values that are used
for the `code` elements, i.e. `notset` for CONFD_ERR_NOTSET, etc. For
`CONFD_ERRTYPE_VALIDATION`, the callback also has full information about
the transaction that failed validation via the
`struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx` element - it is even possible to use
`maapi_attach()` (see [confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi)) to
attach to the transaction and read arbitrary data from it, in case the
data directly related to the error (as given in the code-specific
struct) is not sufficient.

For the other error types, the corresponding `confd_errinfo_xxx` struct
gives the code and an array with the parameters for the default error
message, as defined by the \<fmt\> element in `errcode.xml`:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
enum confd_errinfo_ptype {
    CONFD_ERRINFO_KEYPATH,
    CONFD_ERRINFO_STRING
};
```

``` c
struct confd_errinfo_param {
    enum confd_errinfo_ptype type;
    union {
        confd_hkeypath_t *kp;
        char *str;
    } val;
};
```

``` c
struct confd_errinfo_bad_value {
    int code;
    int n_params;
    struct confd_errinfo_param *params;
};
```

</div>

The parameters in the `params` array are given in the order they appear
in the \<fmt\> specification. Parameters that are specified as `{path}`
have `params[n].type` set to `CONFD_ERRINFO_KEYPATH`, and are
represented as a `confd_hkeypath_t` that can be accessed via
`params[n].val.kp`. All other parameters are represented as strings,
i.e. `params[n].type` is `CONFD_ERRINFO_STR` and the string value can be
accessed via `params[n].val.str`. The `struct confd_errinfo_cli cli` and
`struct confd_errinfo_misc misc` union members have the same form as
`struct confd_errinfo_bad_value` shown above.

Finally, the `default_msg` callback parameter gives the default error
message that will be reported to the user if the `format_error()`
function does not generate a replacement.

    void confd_error_seterr(
    struct confd_user_info *uinfo, const char *fmt, ...);

This function must be called by `format_error()` to provide a
replacement of the default error message. If `format_error()` returns
without calling `confd_error_seterr()`, the default message will be
used.

Here is an example that targets a specific validation error for a
specific element in the data model. For this case only, it replaces
ConfD's internally generated messages of the form:

`"too many 'protocol bgp', 2 configured, at most 1 must be configured"`

with

`"Only 1 bgp instance is supported, cannot define 2"`

<div class="informalexample">

    #include <confd_lib.h>
    #include <confd_dp.h>
    #include <confd_errcode.h>
    .
    .
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
         struct confd_error_cb ecb;
         .
         .
         memset(&ecb, 0, sizeof(ecb));
         ecb.error_types = CONFD_ERRTYPE_VALIDATION;
         ecb.format_error = format_error;
         if (confd_register_error_cb(dctx, &ecb) != CONFD_OK)
              confd_fatal("Couldn't register error callback\n");
         .
    }

    static void format_error(struct confd_user_info *uinfo,
                             struct confd_errinfo *errinfo,
                             char *default_msg)
    {
         struct confd_errinfo_validation *err;
         confd_hkeypath_t *kp;

         err = &errinfo->info.validation;
         if (err->code == CONFD_ERR_TOO_MANY_ELEMS) {
              kp = err->info.too_many_elems.kp;
              if (CONFD_GET_XMLTAG(&kp->v[0][0]) == myns_bgp &&
                  CONFD_GET_XMLTAG(&kp->v[1][0]) == myns_protocol) {
                  confd_error_seterr(uinfo,
                                     "Only %d bgp instance is supported, "
                                     "cannot define %d",
                                     err->info.too_many_elems.max,
                                     err->info.too_many_elems.n);
              }
         }
    }

</div>

The CLI-specific "Aborted: " prefix is not included in the message for
this error type - if we wanted to replace that too, we could include the
`CONFD_ERRTYPE_CLI` error type in the registration and process the
`CONFD_CLI_COMMAND_ABORTED` error code for this type, see `errcode.xml`.

### Library

NSO Library, (`libconfd`, `-lconfd`)

### Description

The `libconfd` shared library is used to connect to NSO and subscribe to
certain events generated by NSO. The API to receive events from NSO is a
socket based API whereby the application connects to NSO and receives
events on a socket. See also the Notifications chapter in Northbound
APIs. The program `misc/notifications/confd_notifications.c` in the
examples collection illustrates subscription and processing for all
these events, and can also be used standalone in a development
environment to monitor NSO events.

> **Note**  
>  
> Any event may allocate memory dynamically inside the
> `struct confd_notification`, thus we must always call
> `confd_free_notification()` after receiving and processing an event.

### Events

The following events can be subscribed to:

`CONFD_NOTIF_AUDIT`  
> All audit log events are sent from ConfD on the event notification
> socket.

`CONFD_NOTIF_AUDIT_SYNC`  
> This flag modifies the behavior of a subscription for the
> `CONFD_NOTIF_AUDIT` event - it has no effect unless
> `CONFD_NOTIF_AUDIT` is also present. If this flag is present, ConfD
> will stop processing in the user session that causes an audit
> notification to be sent, and continue processing in that user session
> only after all subscribers with this flag have called
> `confd_sync_audit_notification()`.

`CONFD_NOTIF_DAEMON`  
> All log events that also goes to the /confdConf/logs/confdLog log are
> sent from ConfD on the event notification socket.

`CONFD_NOTIF_NETCONF`  
> All log events that also goes to the /confdConf/logs/netconfLog log
> are sent from ConfD on the event notification socket.

`CONFD_NOTIF_DEVEL`  
> All log events that also goes to the /confdConf/logs/developerLog log
> are sent from ConfD on the event notification socket.

`CONFD_NOTIF_JSONRPC`  
> All log events that also goes to the /confdConf/logs/jsonrpcLog log
> are sent from ConfD on the event notification socket.

`CONFD_NOTIF_WEBUI`  
> All log events that also goes to the /confdConf/logs/webuiAccessLog
> log are sent from ConfD on the event notification socket.

`CONFD_NOTIF_TAKEOVER_SYSLOG`  
> If this flag is present, ConfD will stop syslogging. The idea behind
> the flag is that we want to configure syslogging for ConfD in order to
> let ConfD log its startup sequence. Once ConfD is started we wish to
> subsume the syslogging done by ConfD. Typical applications that use
> this flag want to pick up all log messages, reformat them and use some
> local logging method.
>
> Once all subscriber sockets with this flag set are closed, ConfD will
> resume to syslog.

`CONFD_NOTIF_COMMIT_SIMPLE`  
> An event indicating that a user has somehow modified the
> configuration.

`CONFD_NOTIF_COMMIT_DIFF`  
> An event indicating that a user has somehow modified the
> configuration. The main difference between this event and the
> abovementioned CONFD_NOTIF_COMMIT_SIMPLE is that this event is
> synchronous, i.e. the entire transaction hangs until we have
> explicitly called `confd_diff_notification_done()`. The purpose of
> this event is to give the applications a chance to read the
> configuration diffs from the transaction before it finishes. A user
> subscribing to this event can use MAAPI to attach (`maapi_attach()`)
> to the running transaction and use `maapi_diff_iterate()` to iterate
> through the diff. This feature can also be used to produce a complete
> audit trail of who changed what and when in the system. It is up to
> the application to format that audit trail.

`CONFD_NOTIF_COMMIT_FAILED`  
> This event is generated when a data provider fails in its commit
> callback. ConfD executes a two-phase commit procedure towards all data
> providers when committing transactions. When a provider fails in
> commit, the system is an unknown state. See
> [confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi) and the function
> `maapi_get_running_db_state()`. If the provider is "external", the
> name of failing daemon is provided. If the provider is another NETCONF
> agent, the IP address and port of that agent is provided.

`CONFD_NOTIF_CONFIRMED_COMMIT`  
> This event is generated when a user has started a confirmed commit,
> when a confirming commit is issued, or when a confirmed commit is
> aborted; represented by `enum confd_confirmed_commit_type`.
>
> For a confirmed commit, the timeout value is also present in the
> notification.

`CONFD_NOTIF_COMMIT_PROGRESS`  
> This event provides progress information about the commit of a
> transaction. The application receives a
> `struct confd_progress_notification` which gives details for the
> specific transaction along with the progress information, see
> `confd_events.h`.

`CONFD_NOTIF_PROGRESS`  
> This event provides progress information about the commit of a
> transaction or an action being applied. The application receives a
> `struct confd_progress_notification` which gives details for the
> specific transaction/action along with the progress information, see
> `confd_events.h`.

`CONFD_NOTIF_USER_SESSION`  
> An event related to user sessions. There are 6 different user session
> related event types, defined in `enum confd_user_sess_type`: session
> starts/stops, session locks/unlocks database, session starts/stop
> database transaction.

`CONFD_NOTIF_HA_INFO`  
> An event related to ConfDs perception of the current cluster
> configuration.

`CONFD_NOTIF_HA_INFO_SYNC`  
> This flag modifies the behavior of a subscription for the
> `CONFD_NOTIF_HA_INFO` event - it has no effect unless
> `CONFD_NOTIF_HA_INFO` is also present. If this flag is present, ConfD
> will stop all HA processing, and continue only after all subscribers
> with this flag have called `confd_sync_ha_notification()`.

`CONFD_NOTIF_SUBAGENT_INFO`  
> Only sent if ConfD runs as a primary agent with subagents enabled.
> This event is sent when the subagent connection is lost or
> reestablished. There are two event types, defined in
> `enum confd_subagent_info_type`: subagent up and subagent down.

`CONFD_NOTIF_SNMPA`  
> This event is generated whenever an SNMP pdu is processed by ConfD.
> The application receives a `struct confd_snmpa_notification`
> structure. The structure contains a series of fields describing the
> sent or received SNMP pdu. It contains a list of all varbinds in the
> pdu.
>
> Each varbind contains a `confd_value_t` with the string representation
> of the SNMP value. Thus the type of the value in a varbind is always
> C_BUF. See `confd_events.h` include file for the details of the
> received structure.

`CONFD_NOTIF_FORWARD_INFO`  
> This event is generated whenever ConfD forwards (proxies) a northbound
> agent.

`CONFD_NOTIF_UPGRADE_EVENT`  
> This event is generated for the different phases of an in-service
> upgrade, i.e. when the data model is upgraded while ConfD is running.
> The application receives a `struct confd_upgrade_notification` where
> the `enum confd_upgrade_event_type event` gives the specific upgrade
> event, see `confd_events.h`. The events correspond to the invocation
> of the MAAPI functions that drive the upgrade, see
> [confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi).

`CONFD_NOTIF_HEARTBEAT`  
> This event can be be used by applications that wish to monitor the
> health and liveness of ConfD itself. It needs to be requested through
> a call to `confd_notifications_connect2()`, where the required
> `heartbeat_interval` can be provided via the
> `struct confd_notifications_data` parameter. ConfD will continuously
> generate heartbeat events on the notification socket. If ConfD fails
> to do so, ConfD is hung, or prevented from getting the CPU time
> required to send the event. The timeout interval is measured in
> milliseconds. Recommended value is 10000 milliseconds to cater for
> truly high load situations. Values less than 1000 are changed to 1000.

`CONFD_NOTIF_HEALTH_CHECK`  
> This event is similar to `CONFD_NOTIF_HEARTBEAT`, in that it can be be
> used by applications that wish to monitor the health and liveness of
> ConfD itself. However while `CONFD_NOTIF_HEARTBEAT` will be generated
> as long as ConfD is not completely hung, `CONFD_NOTIF_HEALTH_CHECK`
> will only be generated after a basic liveness check of the different
> ConfD subsystems has completed successfully. This event also needs to
> be requested through a call to `confd_notifications_connect2()`, where
> the required `health_check_interval` can be provided via the
> `struct confd_notifications_data` parameter. Since the event
> generation incurs more processing than `CONFD_NOTIF_HEARTBEAT`, a
> longer interval than 10000 milliseconds is recommended, but in
> particular the application must be prepared for the actual interval to
> be significantly longer than the requested one in high load
> situations. Values less than 1000 are changed to 1000.

`CONFD_NOTIF_REOPEN_LOGS`  
> This event indicates that NSO will close and reopen its log files,
> i.e. that `ncs --reload` or `maapi_reopen_logs()` (e.g. via
> `ncs_cmd -c reopen_logs`) has been used.

`CONFD_NOTIF_STREAM_EVENT`  
> This event is generated for a notification stream, i.e. event
> notifications sent by an application as described in the [NOTIFICATION
> STREAMS](section3.md#confd_lib_dp.notification_streams) section of
> [confd_lib_dp(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_dp). The application receives a
> `struct confd_stream_notification` where the
> `enum confd_stream_notif_type type` gives the specific event that
> occurred, see `confd_events.h`. This can be either an actual event
> notification (`CONFD_STREAM_NOTIFICATION_EVENT`), one of
> `CONFD_STREAM_NOTIFICATION_COMPLETE` or
> `CONFD_STREAM_REPLAY_COMPLETE`, which indicates that a requested
> replay has completed, or `CONFD_STREAM_REPLAY_FAILED`, which indicates
> that a requested replay could not be carried out. In all cases except
> `CONFD_STREAM_NOTIFICATION_EVENT`, no further
> `CONFD_NOTIF_STREAM_EVENT` events will be delivered on the socket.
>
> This event also needs to be requested through a call to
> `confd_notifications_connect2()`, where the required `stream_name`
> must be provided via the `struct confd_notifications_data` parameter.
> The additional elements in the struct can be used as follows:
>
> - The `start_time` element can be given to request a replay, in which
>   case `stop_time` can also be given to specify the end of the replay
>   (or "live feed"). The `start_time` and `stop_time` must be set to
>   the type C_NOEXISTS to indicate that no value is given, otherwise
>   values of type C_DATETIME must be given.
>
> - The `xpath_filter` element may be used to specify an XPath filter to
>   be applied to the notification stream. If no filtering is wanted,
>   `xpath_filter` must be set to NULL.
>
> - The `usid` element may be used to specify the id of an existing user
>   session for filtering based on AAA rules. Only notifications that
>   are allowed by the access rights of that user session will be
>   received. If no AAA restrictions are wanted, `usid` must be set to
>   `0`.

`CONFD_NOTIF_COMPACTION`  
> This event is generated after each CDB compaction performed by NSO.
> The application receives a `struct confd_compaction_notification`
> where the `enum confd_compaction_dbfile` indicates which datastore was
> compacted, and `enum confd_compaction_type` indicates whether the
> compaction was triggered manually or automatically by the system. The
> notification contains additional information on compaction time,
> datastore sizes and the number of transactions since the last
> compaction. See `confd_events.h` for more information.

`NCS_NOTIF_PACKAGE_RELOAD`  
> This event is generated whenever NSO has completed a package reload.

`NCS_NOTIF_CQ_PROGRESS`  
> This event is generated to report the progress of commit queue
> entries.
>
> The application receives a `struct ncs_cq_progress_notification` where
> the `enum ncs_cq_progress_notif_type type` gives the specific event
> that occurred, see `confd_events.h`. This can be one of
> `NCS_CQ_ITEM_WAITING` (waiting on another executing entry),
> `NCS_CQ_ITEM_EXECUTING`, `NCS_CQ_ITEM_LOCKED` (stalled by parent queue
> in cluster), `NCS_CQ_ITEM_COMPLETED`, `NCS_CQ_ITEM_FAILED` or
> `NCS_CQ_ITEM_DELETED`.

`NCS_NOTIF_CALL_HOME_INFO`  
> This event is generated for a NETCONF Call Home connection. The
> application receives a `struct ncs_call_home_notification` structure.
> See `confd_events.h` include file for the details of the received
> structure.

`NCS_NOTIF_AUDIT_NETWORK`  
> This event is generated whenever any config change is sent southbound
> towards a device.

`NCS_NOTIF_AUDIT_NETWORK_SYNC`  
> This flag modifies the behavior of a subscription for the
> `NCS_NOTIF_AUDIT_NETWORK` event - it has no effect unless
> `NCS_NOTIF_AUDIT_NETWORK` is also present. If this flag is present,
> NSO will stop processing in the user session that causes an audit
> network notification to be sent, and continue processing in that user
> session only after all subscribers with this flag have called
> `ncs_sync_audit_network_notification()`.

Several of the above notification messages contain a lognumber which
identifies the event. All log numbers are listed in the file
`confd_logsyms.h`. Furthermore the array `confd_log_symbols[]` can be
indexed with the lognumber and it contains the symbolic name of each
error. The array `confd_log_descriptions[]` can also be indexed with the
lognumber and it contains a textual description of the logged event.

### Functions

The API to receive events from ConfD is:

    int confd_notifications_connect(
    int sock, const struct sockaddr* srv, int srv_sz, confd_notification_type mask);

    int confd_notifications_connect2(
    int sock, const struct sockaddr* srv, int srv_sz, confd_notification_type mask, 
    struct confd_notifications_data *data);

These functions create a notification socket. The `mask` is a bitmask of
one or several `confd_notification_type` values.

The `confd_notifications_connect2()` variant is required if we wish to
subscribe to `CONFD_NOTIF_HEARTBEAT`, `CONFD_NOTIF_HEALTH_CHECK`, or
`CONFD_NOTIF_STREAM_EVENT` events. The `struct confd_notifications_data`
is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_notifications_data {
    int heartbeat_interval;    /* required if we wish to generate */
                               /* CONFD_NOTIF_HEARTBEAT events    */
                               /* the time is milli seconds       */
    int health_check_interval; /* required if we wish to generate */
                               /* CONFD_NOTIF_HEALTH_CHECK events */
                               /* the time is milli seconds       */
    /* The following five are used for CONFD_NOTIF_STREAM_EVENT */
    char *stream_name;        /* stream name (required)          */
    confd_value_t start_time; /* type = C_NOEXISTS or C_DATETIME */
    confd_value_t stop_time;  /* type = C_NOEXISTS or C_DATETIME */
                              /* when start_time is C_DATETIME   */
    char *xpath_filter;       /* optional XPath filter for the   */
                              /* stream -  NULL for no filter    */
    int usid;                 /* optional user session id for    */
                              /* AAA  restriction - 0 for no AAA */
    /* The following are used for CONFD_NOTIF_PROGRESS and */
    /* CONFD_NOTIF_COMMIT_PROGRESS                         */
    enum confd_progress_verbosity verbosity; /* optional verbosity level      */
};
```

</div>

When requesting the `CONFD_NOTIF_STREAM_EVENT` event,
`confd_notifications_connect2()` may fail and return CONFD_ERR, with
some specific `confd_errno` values:

`CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS`  
> The stream name given by `stream_name` does not exist.

`CONFD_ERR_XPATH`  
> The XPath filter provided via `xpath_filter` failed to compile.

`CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION`  
> The user session id given by `usid` does not identify an existing user
> session.

> **Note**  
>  
> If these calls fail (i.e. do not return CONFD_OK), the socket
> descriptor must be closed and a new socket created before the call is
> re-attempted.

    int confd_read_notification(
    int sock, struct confd_notification *n);

The application is responsible for polling the notification socket. Once
data is available to be read on the socket the application must call
`confd_read_notification()` to read the data from the socket. On success
the function returns CONFD_OK and populates the
`struct confd_notification*` pointer. See `confd_events.h` for the
definition of the `struct confd_notification` structure.

If the application is not reading from the socket and a write() from
ConfD hangs for more than 15 seconds, ConfD will close the socket and
log the event to the confdLog

    void confd_free_notification(
    struct confd_notification *n);

The `struct confd_notification` can sometimes have memory dynamically
allocated inside it. This function must be called to free any memory
allocated inside the received notification structure.

For those notification structures that do not have any memory allocated,
this function is a no-op, thus it is always safe to call this function
after a notification structure has been processed.

    int confd_diff_notification_done(
    int sock, struct confd_trans_ctx  *tctx);

If the received event was CONFD_NOTIF_COMMIT_DIFF it is important that
we call this function when we are done reading the transaction diffs
over MAAPI. The transaction is hanging until this function gets called.
This function also releases memory associated to the transaction in the
library.

    int confd_sync_audit_notification(
    int sock, int usid);

If the received event was CONFD_NOTIF_AUDIT, and we are subscribing to
notifications with the flag CONFD_NOTIF_AUDIT_SYNC, this function must
be called when we are done processing the notification. The user session
is hanging until this function gets called.

    int confd_sync_ha_notification(
    int sock);

If the received event was CONFD_NOTIF_HA_INFO, and we are subscribing to
notifications with the flag CONFD_NOTIF_HA_INFO_SYNC, this function must
be called when we are done processing the notification. All HA
processing is blocked until this function gets called.

    int ncs_sync_audit_network_notification(
    int sock, int usid);

If the received event was NCS_NOTIF_AUDIT_NETWORK, and we are
subscribing to notifications with the flag NCS_NOTIF_AUDIT_NETWORK_SYNC,
this function must be called when we are done processing the
notification. The user session will hang until this function is called.

    int sock, const struct sockaddr* srv, int srv_sz, const char *token);

Connect a HA socket which can be used to control a NSO HA node. The
token is a secret string that must be shared by all participants in the
cluster. There can only be one HA socket towards NSO, a new call to
`confd_ha_connect()` makes NSO close the previous connection and reset
the token to the new value. Returns CONFD_OK or CONFD_ERR.

> **Note**  
>  
> If this call fails (i.e. does not return CONFD_OK), the socket
> descriptor must be closed and a new socket created before the call is
> re-attempted.

    int confd_ha_beprimary(
    int sock, confd_value_t *mynodeid);

Instruct a HA node to be primary and also give the node a name. Returns
CONFD_OK or CONFD_ERR.

*Errors:* CONFD_ERR_HA_BIND if we cannot bind the TCP socket,
CONFD_ERR_BADSTATE if NSO is still in start phase 0.

    int confd_ha_besecondary(
    int sock, confd_value_t *mynodeid, struct confd_ha_node *primary, int waitreply);

Instruct a NSO HA node to be secondary to a named primary. The
`waitreply` is a boolean int. If 1, the function is synchronous and it
will hang until the node has initialized its CDB database. This may mean
that the CDB database is copied in its entirety from the primary. If 0,
we do not wait for the reply, but it is possible to use a notifications
socket and get notified asynchronously via a HA_INFO_BESECONDARY_RESULT
notification. In both cases, it is also possible to use a notifications
socket and get notified asynchronously when CDB at the secondary is
initialized.

If the call of this function fails with `confd_errno`
CONFD_ERR_HA_CLOSED, it means that the initial synchronization with the
primary failed, either due to the socket being closed or due to a
timeout while waiting for a response from the primary. The function will
fail with error CONFD_ERR_BADSTATE if NSO is still in start phase 0.

*Errors:* CONFD_ERR_HA_CONNECT, CONFD_ERR_HA_BADNAME,
CONFD_ERR_HA_BADTOKEN, CONFD_ERR_HA_BADFXS, CONFD_ERR_HA_BADVSN,
CONFD_ERR_HA_CLOSED, CONFD_ERR_BADSTATE, CONFD_ERR_HA_BADCONFIG

    int confd_ha_berelay(
    int sock);

Instruct an established HA secondary node to be a relay for other
secondaries. This can be useful in certain deployment scenarios, but
makes the management of the cluster more complex. Returns CONFD_OK or
CONFD_ERR.

*Errors:* CONFD_ERR_HA_BIND if we cannot bind the TCP socket,
CONFD_ERR_BADSTATE if the node is not already a secondary.

    int confd_ha_benone(
    int sock);

Instruct a node to resume the initial state, i.e. neither primary nor
secondary.

*Errors:* CONFD_ERR_BADSTATE if NSO is still in start phase 0.

    int confd_ha_get_status(
    int sock, struct confd_ha_status *stat);

Query a NSO HA node for its status. If successful, the function
populates the confd_ha_status structure. This is the only HA related
function which is possible to call while the NSO daemon is still in
start phase 0.

    int confd_ha_secondary_dead(
    int sock, confd_value_t *nodeid);

This function must be used by the application to inform NSO HA subsystem
that another node which is possibly connected to NSO is dead.

*Errors:* CONFD_ERR_BADSTATE if NSO is still in start phase 0.

### Library

NSO Library, (`libconfd`, `-lconfd`)

### Description

The `libconfd` shared library is used to connect to NSO. This manual
page describes functions and data structures that are not specific to
any one of the APIs that are described in the other confd_lib_xxx(3)
manual pages.

### Functions

    void confd_init(
    const char *name, FILE *estream, const enum confd_debug_level debug);

Initializes the ConfD library. Must be called before any other NSO API
functions are called.

The `debug` parameter is used to control the debug level. The following
levels are available:

`CONFD_SILENT`  
> No printouts whatsoever are produced by the library.

`CONFD_DEBUG`  
> Various printouts will occur for various error conditions. This is a
> decent value to have as default. If syslog is enabled for the library,
> these printouts will be logged at syslog level `LOG_ERR`, except for
> errors where `confd_errno` is `CONFD_ERR_INTERNAL`, which are logged
> at syslog level `LOG_CRIT`.

`CONFD_TRACE`  
> The execution of callback functions and CDB/MAAPI API calls will be
> traced. This is very verbose and very useful during debugging. If
> syslog is enabled for the library, these printouts will be logged at
> syslog level `LOG_DEBUG`.

`CONFD_PROTO_TRACE`  
> The low-level protocol exchange between the application and NSO will
> be traced. This is even more verbose than `CONFD_TRACE`, and normally
> only of interest to Cisco support. These printouts will not be logged
> via syslog, i.e. a non-NULL value for the `estream` parameter must be
> provided.

The `estream` parameter is used by all printouts from the library. The
`name` parameter is typically included in most of the debug printouts.
If the `estream` parameter is NULL, no printouts to a file will occur.
Independent of the `estream` parameter, syslog can be enabled for the
library by setting the global variable `confd_lib_use_syslog` to `1`.
See [SYSLOG AND DEBUG](section3.md#confd_lib_lib.syslog_and_debug) in this
man page.

    int confd_set_debug(
    enum confd_debug_level debug, FILE *estream);

This function can be used to change the `estream` and `debug` parameters
for the library.

    int confd_load_schemas(
    const struct sockaddr* srv, int srv_sz);

Utility function that uses `maapi_load_schemas()` (see
[confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi)) to load schema information
from NSO. This function connects to NSO and loads all the schema
information in NSO for all loaded "fxs" files into the library. This is
necessary in order to get proper printouts of e.g. confd_hkeypaths which
otherwise just contains arrays of integers. This function should
typically always be called when we initialize the library. See
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types).

Use of this utility function is discouraged as the caller has no control
over how the socket communicating with NSO is created. We recommend
calling `maapi_load_schemas()` directly (see
[confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi)).

    int confd_load_schemas_list(
    const struct sockaddr* srv, int srv_sz, int flags, const uint32_t *nshash, 
    const int *nsflags, int num_ns);

Utility function that uses `maapi_load_schemas_list()` to load a subset
of the schema information from NSO. See the description of
`maapi_load_schemas_list()` in
[confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi) for the details of how to
use the `flags`, `nshash`, `nsflags`, and `num_ns` parameters.

Use of this utility function is discouraged as the caller has no control
over how the socket communicating with NSO is created. We recommend
calling `maapi_load_schemas_list()` directly (see
[confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi)).

    int confd_mmap_schemas_setup(
    void *addr, size_t size, const char *filename, int flags);

This function sets up for a subsequent call of one of the schema-loading
functions (`confd_load_schemas()` etc) to load the schema information
into a shared memory segment instead of into the process' heap. The
`addr` and (potentially) `size` arguments are passed to `mmap(2)`, and
`filename` specifies the pathname of a file to use as backing store. The
`flags` parameter can be given as `CONFD_MMAP_SCHEMAS_KEEP_SIZE` to
request that the shared memory segment should be exactly the size given
by the (non-zero) `size` argument - if this size is insufficient to hold
the schema information, the schema-loading function will fail.

    int confd_mmap_schemas(
    const char *filename);

Map a shared memory segment, previously created by
`confd_mmap_schemas_setup()` and subsequent schema loading, into the
current process' address space, and make it ready for use. The
`filename` argument specifies the pathname of the file that is used as
backing store. See also /ncs-config/enable-shared-memory-schema in
[ncs.conf(5)](section5.md#ncs.conf) and `maapi_get_schema_file_path()` in
[confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi).

    void confd_free_schemas(
    void);

Free or unmap the memory allocated or mapped by schema loading, undoing
the result of loading - i.e. schema information will no longer be
available. There is normally no need to call this function, since the
memory will be automatically freed/unmapped if a new schema loading is
done, or when the process terminates, but it may be useful in some
cases.

    int confd_svcmp(
    const char *s, const confd_value_t *v);

Utility function with similar semantics to `strcmp()` which compares a
`confd_value_t` to a `char*`.

    int confd_pp_value(
    char *buf, int bufsiz, const confd_value_t *v);

Utility function which pretty prints up to `bufsiz` characters into
`buf`, giving a string representation of the value `v`. Since only the
"primitive" type as defined by the `enum confd_vtype` is available,
`confd_pp_value()` can not produce a true string representation in all
cases, see the list below. If this is a problem, use `confd_val2str()`
instead.

`C_ENUM_VALUE`  
> The value is printed as "enum\<N\>", where N is the integer value.

`C_BIT32`  
> The value is printed as "bits\<X\>", where X is an unsigned integer in
> hexadecimal format.

`C_BIT64`  
> The value is printed as "bits\<X\>", where X is an unsigned integer in
> hexadecimal format.

`C_BITBIG`  
> The value is printed as "bits\<X\>", where X is an unsigned integer
> (possibly very large) in hexadecimal format.

`C_BINARY`  
> The string representation for `xs:hexBinary` is used, i.e. a sequence
> of hexadecimal characters.

`C_DECIMAL64`  
> If the value of the `fraction_digits` element is within the possible
> range (1..18), it is assumed to be correct for the type and used for
> the string representation. Otherwise the value is printed as
> "invalid64\<N\>", where N is the value of the `value` element.

`C_XMLTAG`  
> The string representation is printed if schema information has been
> loaded into the library. Otherwise the value is printed as "tag\<N\>",
> where N is the integer value.

`C_IDENTITYREF`  
> The string representation is printed if schema information has been
> loaded into the library. Otherwise the value is printed as
> "idref\<N\>", where N is the integer value.

All the `pp` pretty print functions, i.e. `confd_pp_value()`
`confd_ns_pp_value()`, `confd_pp_kpath()` and `confd_xpath_pp_kpath()`,
as well as the `confd_format_keypath()` and `confd_val2str()` functions,
return the number of characters printed (not including the trailing NUL
used to end output to strings) if there is enough space.

The formatting functions do not write more than `bufsiz` bytes
(including the trailing NUL). If the output was truncated due to this
limit then the return value is the number of characters (not including
the trailing NUL) which would have been written to the final string if
enough space had been available. Thus, a return value of `bufsiz` or
more means that the output was truncated.

Except for `confd_val2str()`, these functions will never return
CONFD_ERR or any other negative value.

    int confd_ns_pp_value(
    char *buf, int bufsiz, const confd_value_t *v, int ns);

This function is deprecated, but will remain for backward compatibility.
It just calls `confd_pp_value()` - use `confd_pp_value()` directly, or
`confd_val2str()` (see below), instead.

    int confd_pp_kpath(
    char *buf, int bufsiz, const confd_hkeypath_t *hkeypath);

Utility function which pretty prints up to `bufsiz` characters into
`buf`, giving a string representation of the path `hkeypath`. This will
use the NSO curly brace notation, i.e. "/servers/server{www}/ip".
Requires that schema information is available to the library, see
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types). Same return value as
`confd_pp_value()`.

    int confd_pp_kpath_len(
    char *buf, int bufsiz, const confd_hkeypath_t *hkeypath, int len);

A variant of `confd_pp_kpath()` that prints only the first `len`
elements of `hkeypath`.

    int confd_format_keypath(
    char *buf, int bufsiz, const char *fmt, ...);

Several of the functions in [confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi)
and [confd_lib_cdb(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_cdb) take a variable number of
arguments which are then, similar to printf, used to generate the path
passed to NSO - see the [PATHS](section3.md#confd_lib_cdb.paths) section of
confd_lib_cdb(3). This function takes the same arguments, but only
formats the path as a string, writing at most `bufsiz` characters into
`buf`. If the path is absolute and schema information is available to
the library, key values referenced by a "%x" modifier will be printed
according to their specific type, i.e. effectively using
`confd_val2str()`, otherwise `confd_pp_value()` is used. Same return
value as `confd_pp_value()`.

    int confd_vformat_keypath(
    char *buf, int bufsiz, const char *fmt, va_list ap);

Does the same as `confd_format_keypath()`, but takes a single va_list
argument instead of a variable number of arguments - i.e. similar to
vprintf. Same return value as `confd_pp_value()`.

    char *confd_xmltag2str(
    uint32_t ns, uint32_t xmltag);

This function is deprecated, but will remain for backward compatibility.
It just calls `confd_hash2str()` - use `confd_hash2str()` directly
instead, see below.

    int confd_xpath_pp_kpath(
    char *buf, int bufsiz, uint32_t ns, const confd_hkeypath_t *hkeypath);

Similar to `confd_pp_kpath()` except that the path is formatted as an
XPath path, i.e. "/servers:servers/server\[name="www"\]/ip". This
function can also take the namespace integer as an argument. If `0` is
passed as `ns`, the namespace is derived from the hkeypath. Requires
that schema information is available to the library, see
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types). Same return value as
`confd_pp_value()`.

    int confd_get_nslist(
    struct confd_nsinfo **listp);

Provides a list of the namespaces known to the library as an array of
`struct confd_nsinfo` structures:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_nsinfo {
    const char *uri;
    const char *prefix;
    uint32_t hash;
    const char *revision;
    const char *module;
};
```

</div>

A pointer to the array is stored in `*listp`, and the function returns
the number of elements in the array. The `module` element in
`struct confd_nsinfo` will give the module name for namespaces defined
by YANG modules, otherwise it is NULL. The `revision` element will give
the revision for YANG modules that have a `revision` statement,
otherwise it is NULL.

    char *confd_ns2prefix(
    uint32_t ns);

Returns a NUL-terminated string giving the namespace prefix for the
namespace `ns`, if the namespace is known to the library - otherwise it
returns NULL.

    char *confd_hash2str(
    uint32_t hash);

Returns a NUL-terminated string representing the node name given by
`hash`, or NULL if the hash value is not found. Requires that schema
information has been loaded from the NSO daemon into the library, see
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) - otherwise it always returns NULL.

    uint32_t confd_str2hash(
    const char *str);

Returns the hash value representing the node name given by `str`, or 0
if the string is not found. Requires that schema information has been
loaded from the NSO daemon into the library, see
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) - otherwise it always returns 0.

    struct confd_cs_node *confd_find_cs_root(
    uint32_t ns);

When schema information is available to the library, this function
returns the root of the tree representaton of the namespace given by
`ns`, i.e. a pointer to the `struct confd_cs_node` for the (first)
toplevel node. For namespaces that are augmented into other namespaces
such that they do not have a toplevel node, this function returns NULL -
the nodes of such a namespace are found below the `augment` target
node(s) in other tree(s). See [confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types).

    struct confd_cs_node *confd_find_cs_node(
    const confd_hkeypath_t *hkeypath, int len);

Utility function which finds the `struct confd_cs_node` corresponding to
the `len` first elements of the hashed keypath. To make the search
consider the full keypath, pass the `len` element from the
`confd_hkeypath_t` structure (i.e. `mykeypath->len`). See
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types).

    struct confd_cs_node *confd_find_cs_node_child(
    const struct confd_cs_node *parent, struct xml_tag xmltag);

Utility function which finds the `struct confd_cs_node` corresponding to
the child node given as `xmltag`. See
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types).

    struct confd_cs_node *confd_cs_node_cd(
    const struct confd_cs_node *start, const char *fmt, ...);

Utility function which finds the resulting `struct confd_cs_node` given
an (optional) starting node and a (relative or absolute) string keypath.
I.e. this function navigates the tree in a manner corresponding to
`cdb_cd()`/`maapi_cd()`. Note however that the `confd_cs_node` tree does
not have a node corresponding to "/". It is possible to pass `start` as
`NULL`, in which case the path must be absolute (i.e. start with a "/").

Since the key values are not relevant for the tree navigation, the key
elements can be omitted, i.e. a "tagpath" can be used - if present, key
elements are ignored, whether given in the {...} form or the CDB-only
\[N\] form. See [confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types).

If the path can not be found, `NULL` is returned, `confd_errno` is set
to `CONFD_ERR_BADPATH`, and `confd_lasterr()` can be used to retrieve a
string that describes the reason for the failure.

If `NULL` is returned and `confd_errno` is set to
`CONFD_ERR_NO_MOUNT_ID`, it means that the path is ambiguous due to
traversing a mount point. In this case `maapi_cs_node_cd()` or
`cdb_cs_node_cd()` must be used instead, with a path that is fully
instantiated (i.e. all keys provided).

    enum confd_vtype confd_get_base_type(
    struct confd_cs_node *node);

This function returns the base type of a leaf node, as a `confd_vtype`
value.

    int confd_max_object_size(
    struct confd_cs_node *object);

Utility function which returns the maximum size (i.e. the needed length
of the `confd_value_t` array) for an "object" retrieved by
`cdb_get_object()`, `maapi_get_object()`, and corresponding multi-object
functions. The `object` parameter is a pointer to the list or container
`confd_cs_node` node for which we want to find the maximum size. See the
description of `cdb_get_object()` in
[confd_lib_cdb(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_cdb) for usage examples.

    struct confd_cs_node *confd_next_object_node(
    struct confd_cs_node *object, struct confd_cs_node *cur, confd_value_t *value);

Utility function to allow navigation of the `confd_cs_node` schema tree
in parallel with the `confd_value_t` array populated by
`cdb_get_object()`, `maapi_get_object()`, and corresponding multi-object
functions. The `object` parameter is a pointer to the list or container
node as for `confd_max_object_size()`, the `cur` parameter is a pointer
to the `confd_cs_node` node for the current value, and the `value`
parameter is a pointer to the current value in the array. The function
returns a pointer to the `confd_cs_node` node for the next value in the
array, or NULL when the complete object has been traversed. In the
initial call for a given traversal, we must pass `object->children` for
the `cur` parameter - this always points to the `confd_cs_node` node for
the first value in the array. See the description of `cdb_get_object()`
in [confd_lib_cdb(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_cdb) for usage examples.

    struct confd_type *confd_find_ns_type(
    uint32_t nshash, const char *name);

Returns a pointer to a type definition for the type named `name`, which
is defined in the namespace identified by `nshash`, or NULL if the type
could not be found. If `nshash` is 0, the type name will be looked up
among the ConfD built-in types (i.e. the YANG built-in types, the types
defined in the YANG "tailf-common" module, and the types defined in the
"confd" and "xs" namespaces). The type definition pointer can be used
with the `confd_val2str()` and `confd_str2val()` functions, see below.
If `nshash` is not 0, the function requires that schema information has
been loaded from the NSO daemon into the library, see
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) - otherwise it returns NULL.

    struct confd_type *confd_get_leaf_list_type(
    struct confd_cs_node *node);

For a leaf-list node, the `type` field in the
`struct confd_cs_node_info` (see [confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types))
identifies a "list type" for the leaf-list "itself". This function takes
a pointer to the `struct confd_cs_node` for a leaf-list node as
argument, and returns the type of the elements in the leaf-list, i.e.
corresponding to the `type` substatement for the leaf-list in the YANG
module. If called for a node that is not a leaf-list, it returns NULL
and sets `confd_errno` to `CONFD_ERR_PROTOUSAGE`. Requires that schema
information has been loaded from the NSO daemon into the library, see
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) - otherwise it returns NULL and
sets `confd_errno` to `CONFD_ERR_UNAVAILABLE`.

    int confd_val2str(
    struct confd_type *type, const confd_value_t *val, char *buf, int bufsiz);

Prints the string representation of `val` into `buf`, which has the
length `bufsiz`, using type information from the data model. Returns the
length of the string as described for `confd_pp_value()`, or CONFD_ERR
if the value could not be converted (e.g. wrong type). The `type`
pointer can be obtained either from the `struct confd_cs_node`
corresponding to the leaf that `val` pertains to, or via the
`confd_find_ns_type()` function above. The `struct confd_cs_node` can in
turn be obtained by various combinations of the functions that operate
on the `confd_cs_node` trees (see above), or by user-defined functions
for navigating those trees. Requires that schema information has been
loaded from the NSO daemon into the library, see
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types).

    int confd_str2val(
    struct confd_type *type, const char *str, confd_value_t *val);

Stores the value corresponding to the NUL-terminated string `str` in
`val`, using type information from the data model. Returns CONFD_OK, or
CONFD_ERR if the string could not be converted. See `confd_val2str()`
for a description of the `type` argument. Requires that schema
information has been loaded from the NSO daemon into the library, see
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types).

A special case is that CONFD_ERR is returned, with `confd_errno` set to
`CONFD_ERR_NO_MOUNT_ID`. This will only happen when the type is a YANG
instance-identifier, and means that the Xpath expression (i.e. the
string representation) is ambiguous due to traversing a mount point. In
this case `maapi_xpath2kpath_th()` must be used to translate the string
into a `confd_hkeypath_t`, which can then be used with
`CONFD_SET_OBJECTREF()` to create the `confd_value_t` value.

> **Note**  
>  
> When the resulting value is of one of the C_BUF, C_BINARY, C_LIST,
> C_OBJECTREF, C_OID, C_QNAME, C_HEXSTR, or C_BITBIG `confd_value_t`
> types, the library has allocated memory to hold the value. It is up to
> the user of this function to free the memory using
> `confd_free_value()`.

    char *confd_val2str_ptr(
    struct confd_type *type, const confd_value_t *val);

A variant of `confd_val2str()` that can be used only when the string
representation is a constant, i.e. C_ENUM_VALUE values. In this case it
returns a pointer to the string, otherwise NULL. See `confd_val2str()`
for a description of the `type` argument. Requires that schema
information has been loaded from the NSO daemon into the library, see
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types).

    int confd_get_decimal64_fraction_digits(
    struct confd_type *type);

Utility function to obtain the value of the argument to the
`fraction-digits` statement for a YANG `decimal64` type. This is useful
when we want to create a `confd_value_t` for such a type, since the
`value` element must be scaled according to the fraction-digits value.
The function returns the fraction-digits value, or 0 if the `type`
argument does not refer to a `decimal64` type. Requires that schema
information has been loaded from the NSO daemon into the library, see
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types).

    int confd_get_bitbig_size(
    struct confd_type *type);

Utility function to obtain the maximum size needed for the byte array
for the C_BITBIG `confd_value_t` representation used when a YANG `bits`
type has a highest bit position above 63. This is useful when we want to
create a `confd_value_t` for such a type, since an array of this size
can hold the values for all the bits defined for the type. Applications
may however provide a confd_value_t with a shorter (but not longer)
array to NSO. The file generated by `ncsc --emit-h` also includes a
`#define` symbol for this size. The function returns 0 if the `type`
argument does not refer to a `bits` type with a highest bit position
above 63. Requires that schema information has been loaded from the NSO
daemon into the library, see [confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types).

    int confd_hkp_tagmatch(
    struct xml_tag tags[], int tagslen, confd_hkeypath_t *hkp);

When checking the hkeypaths that get passed into each iteration in e.g.
`cdb_diff_iterate()` we can either explicitly check the paths, or use
this function to do the job. The `tags` array (typically statically
initialized) specifies a tagpath to match against the hkeypath. See
`cdb_diff_match()`. The function returns one of these values:

<div class="informalexample">

    #define CONFD_HKP_MATCH_NONE 0
    #define CONFD_HKP_MATCH_TAGS (1 << 0)
    #define CONFD_HKP_MATCH_HKP  (1 << 1)
    #define CONFD_HKP_MATCH_FULL (CONFD_HKP_MATCH_TAGS|CONFD_HKP_MATCH_HKP)

        

</div>

`CONFD_HKP_MATCH_TAGS` means that the whole tagpath was matched by the
hkeypath, and `CONFD_HKP_MATCH_HKP` means that the whole hkeypath was
matched by the tagpath.

    int confd_hkp_prefix_tagmatch(
    struct xml_tag tags[], int tagslen, confd_hkeypath_t *hkp);

A simplified version of `confd_hkp_tagmatch()` - it returns 1 if the
tagpath matches a prefix of the hkeypath, i.e. it is equivalent to
calling `confd_hkp_tagmatch()` and checking if the return value includes
`CONFD_HKP_MATCH_TAGS`.

    int confd_val_eq(
    const confd_value_t *v1, const confd_value_t *v2);

Utility function which compares two values. Returns positive value if
equal, 0 otherwise.

    void confd_fatal(
    const char *fmt);

Utility function which formats a string, prints it to stderr and exits
with exit code 1.

    void confd_free_value(
    confd_value_t *v);

When we retrieve values via the CDB or MAAPI interfaces, or convert
strings to values via `confd_str2val()`, and these values are of either
of the types C_BUF, C_BINARY, C_QNAME, C_OBJECTREF, C_OID, C_LIST,
C_HEXSTR, or C_BITBIG, the library has allocated memory to hold the
values. This memory must be freed by the application when it is done
with the value. This function frees memory for all `confd_value_t`
types. Note that this function does not free the structure itself, only
possible internal pointers inside the struct. Typically we use
`confd_value_t` variables as automatic variables allocated on the stack.
If the held value is of fixed size, e.g. integers, xmltags etc, the
`confd_free_value()` function does nothing.

> **Note**  
>  
> Memory for values received as parameters to callback functions is
> always managed by the library - the application must *not* call
> `confd_free_value()` for those (on the other hand values of the types
> listed above that are received as parameters to a callback function
> must be copied if they are to persist beyond the callback invocation).

    confd_value_t *confd_value_dup_to(
    const confd_value_t *v, confd_value_t *newv);

This function copies the contents of `*v` to `*newv`, allocating memory
for the actual value for the types that need it. It returns `newv`, or
NULL if allocation failed. The allocated memory (if any) can be freed
with `confd_free_dup_to_value()`.

    void confd_free_dup_to_value(
    confd_value_t *v);

Frees memory allocated by `confd_value_dup_to()`. Note this is not the
same as `confd_free_value()`, since `confd_value_dup_to()` also
allocates memory for values of type C_STR - such values are not freed by
`confd_free_value()`.

    confd_value_t *confd_value_dup(
    const confd_value_t *v);

This function allocates memory and duplicates `*v`, i.e. a
`confd_value_t` struct is always allocated, memory for the actual value
is also allocated for the types that need it. Returns a pointer to the
new `confd_value_t`, or NULL if allocation failed. The allocated memory
can be freed with `confd_free_dup_value()`.

    void confd_free_dup_value(
    confd_value_t *v);

Frees memory allocated by `confd_value_dup()`. Note this is not the same
as `confd_free_value()`, since `confd_value_dup()` also allocates the
actual `confd_value_t` struct, and allocates memory for values of type
C_STR - such values are not freed by `confd_free_value()`.

    confd_hkeypath_t *confd_hkeypath_dup(
    const confd_hkeypath_t *src);

This function allocates memory and duplicates a `confd_hkeypath_t`.

    confd_hkeypath_t *confd_hkeypath_dup_len(
    const confd_hkeypath_t *src, int len);

Like `confd_hkeypath_dup()`, but duplicates only the first `len`
elements of the `confd_hkeypath_t`. I.e. the elements are shifted such
that `v[0][0]` still refers to the last element.

    void confd_free_hkeypath(
    confd_hkeypath_t *hkp);

This function will free memory allocated by e.g. `confd_hkeypath_dup()`.

    void confd_free_authorization_info(
    struct confd_authorization_info *ainfo);

This function will free memory allocated by
`maapi_get_authorization_info()`.

    int confd_decrypt(
    const char *ciphertext, int len, char *output);

When data is read over the CDB interface, the MAAPI interface or
received in event notifications, the data for the two builtin types
`tailf:des3-cbc-encrypted-string` or
`tailf:aes-cfb-128-encrypted-string` is encrypted.

This function decrypts `len` bytes of data from `ciphertext` and writes
the clear text to the `output` pointer. The `output` pointer must point
to an area that is at least `len` bytes long.

> **Note**  
>  
> One of the functions `confd_install_crypto_keys()` and
> `maapi_install_crypto_keys()` must have been called before
> `confd_decrypt()` can be used.

### User-Defined Types

It is possible to define new types, i.e. mappings between a textual
representation and a `confd_value_t` representation that are not
pre-defined in the NSO daemon. Read more about this in the
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) manual page.

    int confd_type_cb_init(
    struct confd_type_cbs **cbs);

This is the prototype for the function that a shared object implementing
one or more user-defined types must provide. See
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types).

    int confd_register_ns_type(
    uint32_t nshash, const char *name, struct confd_type *type);

This function can be used to register a user-defined type with the
libconfd library, to make it possible for `confd_str2val()` and
`confd_val2str()` to provide local string\<-\>value translation in the
application. See [confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types).

    int confd_register_node_type(
    struct confd_cs_node *node, struct confd_type *type);

This function provides an alternate way to register a user-defined type
with the libconfd library, in particular when the user-defined type is
specified "inline" in a `leaf` or `leaf-list` statement. See
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types).

### Confd Streams

Some functions in the NSO lib stream data. Either from NSO to the
application of from the application to NSO. The individual functions
that use this feature will explicitly indicate that the data is passed
over a `stream socket`.

    int confd_stream_connect(
    int sock, const struct sockaddr* srv, int srv_sz, int id, int flags);

Connects a stream socket to NSO. The `id` and the `flags` take different
values depending on the usage scenario. This is indicated for each
individual function that makes use of a stream socket.

> **Note**  
>  
> If this call fails (i.e. does not return CONFD_OK), the socket
> descriptor must be closed and a new socket created before the call is
> re-attempted.

### Marshalling

In various distributed scenarios we may want to send confd_lib datatypes
over the network. We have support to marshall and unmarshall some key
datatypes.

    int confd_serialize(
    struct confd_serializable *s, unsigned char *buf, int bufsz, int *bytes_written, 
    unsigned char **allocated);

This function takes a `confd_serializable` struct as parameter. We have:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
enum confd_serializable_type {
    CONFD_SERIAL_NONE      = 0,
    CONFD_SERIAL_VALUE_T   = 1,
    CONFD_SERIAL_HKEYPATH  = 2,
    CONFD_SERIAL_TAG_VALUE = 3
};
```

``` c
struct confd_serializable {
    enum confd_serializable_type type;
    union {
        confd_value_t *value;
        confd_hkeypath_t *hkp;
        confd_tag_value_t *tval;
    } u;
};
```

</div>

The structure must be populated with a valid type and also a value to be
serialized. The serialized data will be written into the provided
buffer. If the size of the buffer is insufficient, the function returns
the required size as a positive integer. If the provided buffer is NULL,
the function will allocate a buffer and it is the responsibility of the
caller to free the buffer. The optionally allocated buffer is then
returned in the output char \*\* parameter `allocated`. The function
returns 0 on success and -1 on failures.

    int confd_deserialize(
    struct confd_deserializable *s, unsigned char *buf);

This function takes a `confd_deserializable` struct as parameter. We
have:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_deserializable {
    enum confd_serializable_type type;
    union {
        confd_value_t value;
        confd_hkeypath_t hkp;
        confd_tag_value_t tval;
    } u;
    void *internal;  // internal structure containing memory
                     // for the above datatypes to point _into_
                     // freed by a call to confd_deserialize_free()
};
```

</div>

This function is the reverse of `confd_serialize()`. It populates the
provided `confd_deserializable` structure with a type indicator and a
reproduced value of the correct type. The structure contains allocated
memory that must subsequently be freed with `confd_deserialiaze()`.

    void confd_deserialized_free(
    struct confd_deserializable *s);

A populated `confd_deserializable` struct contains allocated memory that
must be freed. This function traverses a `confd_deserializable` struct
as populated by the `confd_deserialize()` function and frees all
allocated memory.

### Extended Error Reporting

The data provider callback functions described in
[confd_lib_dp(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_dp) can pass error information back
to NSO either as a simple string using `confd_xxx_seterr()`, or in a
more structured/detailed form using the corresponding
`confd_xxx_seterr_extended()` function. This form is also used when a
CDB subscriber wishes to abort the current transaction with
`cdb_sub_abort_trans()`, see [confd_lib_cdb(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_cdb).
There is also a set of `confd_xxx_seterr_extended_info()` functions and
a `cdb_sub_abort_trans_info()` function, that can alternatively be used
if we want to provide contents for the NETCONF \<error-info\> element.
The description below uses the functions for transaction callbacks as an
example, but the other functions follow the same pattern:

    void confd_trans_seterr_extended(
    struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx, enum confd_errcode code, uint32_t apptag_ns, 
    uint32_t apptag_tag, const char *fmt);

The function can be used also after a data provider callback has
returned CONFD_DELAYED_RESPONSE, but in that case it must be followed by
a call of `confd_delayed_reply_error()` (see
[confd_lib_dp(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_dp)) with NULL for the `errstr`
pointer.

One of the following values can be given for the `code` argument:

`CONFD_ERRCODE_IN_USE`  
> Locking a data store was not possible because it was already locked.

`CONFD_ERRCODE_RESOURCE_DENIED`  
> General resource unavailability, e.g. insufficient memory to carry out
> an operation.

`CONFD_ERRCODE_INCONSISTENT_VALUE`  
> A request parameter had an unacceptable/invalid value

`CONFD_ERRCODE_ACCESS_DENIED`  
> The request could not be fulfilled because authorization did not allow
> it. (No additional error information will be reported by the
> northbound agent, to avoid any security breach.)

`CONFD_ERRCODE_APPLICATION`  
> Unspecified error.

`CONFD_ERRCODE_APPLICATION_INTERNAL`  
> As CONFD_ERRCODE_APPLICATION, but the additional error information is
> only for logging/debugging, and should not be reported by northbound
> agents.

`CONFD_ERRCODE_DATA_MISSING`  
> A request could not be completed because the relevant data model
> content does not exist.

`CONFD_ERRCODE_INTERRUPT`  
> Processing of a request was terminated due to user interrupt - see the
> description of the `interrupt()` transaction callback in
> [confd_lib_dp(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_dp).

There is currently limited support for specifying one of a set of fixed
error tags via `apptag_ns` and `apptag_tag`: `apptag_ns` should be 0,
and `apptag_tag` can be either 0 or the hash value for a data model
node.

The `fmt` and remaining arguments can specify an arbitrary string as for
`confd_trans_seterr()`, but when used with one of the `code` values that
has a specific meaning, it should only be given if it has some
additional information - e.g. passing "In use" with CONFD_ERRCODE_IN_USE
is not meaningful, and will typically result in duplicated information
being reported by the northbound agent. If there is no additional
information, just pass an empty string ("") for `fmt`.

A call of confd_trans_seterr(tctx, "string") is equivalent to
confd_trans_seterr_extended(tctx, CONFD_ERRCODE_APPLICATION, 0, 0,
"string").

When the extended error reporting is used, the northbound agents will,
where possible, use the extended error information to give
protocol-specific error reports to the managers, as described in the
following tables. (The CONFD_ERRCODE_INTERRUPT code does not have a
mapping here, since these interfaces do not provide the possibility to
interrupt a transaction.)

For SNMP, the `code` argument is mapped to SNMP ErrorStatus

| `code`                               | SNMP ErrorStatus      |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `CONFD_ERRCODE_IN_USE`               | `resourceUnavailable` |
| `CONFD_ERRCODE_RESOURCE_DENIED`      | `resourceUnavailable` |
| `CONFD_ERRCODE_INCONSISTENT_VALUE`   | `inconsistentValue`   |
| `CONFD_ERRCODE_ACCESS_DENIED`        | `noAccess`            |
| `CONFD_ERRCODE_APPLICATION`          | `genErr`              |
| `CONFD_ERRCODE_APPLICATION_INTERNAL` | `genErr`              |
| `CONFD_ERRCODE_DATA_MISSING`         | `inconsistentValue`   |

For NETCONF the `code` argument is mapped to \<error-tag\>:

| `code`                               | NETCONF error-tag  |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `CONFD_ERRCODE_IN_USE`               | `in-use`           |
| `CONFD_ERRCODE_RESOURCE_DENIED`      | `resource-denied`  |
| `CONFD_ERRCODE_INCONSISTENT_VALUE`   | `invalid-value`    |
| `CONFD_ERRCODE_ACCESS_DENIED`        | `access-denied`    |
| `CONFD_ERRCODE_APPLICATION_`         | `operation-failed` |
| `CONFD_ERRCODE_APPLICATION_INTERNAL` | `operation-failed` |
| `CONFD_ERRCODE_DATA_MISSING`         | `data-missing`     |

The tag specified by `apptag_ns`/`apptag_tag` will be reported as
\<error-app-tag\>.

For MAAPI the `code` argument is mapped to `confd_errno`:

| `code`                               | `confd_errno`                    |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `CONFD_ERRCODE_IN_USE`               | `CONFD_ERR_INUSE`                |
| `CONFD_ERRCODE_RESOURCE_DENIED`      | `CONFD_ERR_RESOURCE_DENIED`      |
| `CONFD_ERRCODE_INCONSISTENT_VALUE`   | `CONFD_ERR_INCONSISTENT_VALUE`   |
| `CONFD_ERRCODE_ACCESS_DENIED`        | `CONFD_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED`        |
| `CONFD_ERRCODE_APPLICATION`          | `CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL`             |
| `CONFD_ERRCODE_APPLICATION_INTERNAL` | `CONFD_ERR_APPLICATION_INTERNAL` |
| `CONFD_ERRCODE_DATA_MISSING`         | `CONFD_ERR_DATA_MISSING`         |

The tag (if any) can be retrieved by calling

    struct xml_tag *confd_last_error_apptag(
    void);

If no tag was provided by the callback (e.g. plain
`confd_trans_seterr()` was used, or the error did not originate from a
data provider callback at all), this function returns a pointer to a
`struct xml_tag` with both the `ns` and the `tag` element set to 0.

In the CLI and Web UI a text string is produced through some combination
of the `code` and the string given by `fmt, ...`.

    int confd_trans_seterr_extended_info(
    struct confd_trans_ctx *tctx, enum confd_errcode code, uint32_t apptag_ns, 
    uint32_t apptag_tag, confd_tag_value_t *error_info, int n, const char *fmt);

This function can be used to provide structured error information in the
same way as `confd_trans_seterr_extended()`, and additionally provide
contents for the NETCONF \<error-info\> element. The `error_info`
argument is an array of length `n`, populated as described for the
Tagged Value Array format in the [XML
STRUCTURES](section3.md#confd_types.xml_structures) section of the
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) manual page. The `error_info`
information is discarded for other northbound agents than NETCONF.

The `tailf:error-info` statement (see
[tailf_yang_extensions(5)](section5.md#tailf_yang_extensions)) must have been
used in one or more YANG modules to declare the data nodes for
\<error-info\>. As an example, we could have this `error-info`
declaration:

<div class="informalexample">

    module mod {
      namespace "http://tail-f.com/test/mod";
      prefix mod;

      import tailf-common {
        prefix tailf;
      }

      ...

      tailf:error-info {
        leaf severity {
          type enumeration {
            enum info;
            enum error;
            enum critical;
          }
        }
        container detail {
          leaf class {
            type uint8;
          }
          leaf code {
            type uint8;
          }
        }
      }

      ...

    }

</div>

A call of `confd_trans_seterr_extended_info()` to populate the
\<error-info\> could then look like this:

<div class="informalexample">

    confd_tag_value_t error_info[10];
    int i = 0;

    CONFD_SET_TAG_ENUM_VALUE(&error_info[i],
                             mod_severity, mod_error);
    CONFD_SET_TAG_NS(&error_info[i], mod__ns);          i++;
    CONFD_SET_TAG_XMLBEGIN(&error_info[i],
                           mod_detail, mod__ns);        i++;
    CONFD_SET_TAG_UINT8(&error_info[i], mod_class, 42); i++;
    CONFD_SET_TAG_UINT8(&error_info[i], mod_code, 17);  i++;
    CONFD_SET_TAG_XMLEND(&error_info[i],
                         mod_detail, mod__ns);          i++;
    OK(confd_trans_seterr_extended_info(tctx, CONFD_ERRCODE_APPLICATION,
                                        0, 0, error_info, i,
                                        "Operation failed"));

</div>

> **Note**  
>  
> The toplevel elements in the `confd_tag_value_t` array *must* have the

The \<error-info\> section resulting from the above would look like
this:

<div class="informalexample">

          <severity xmlns="http://tail-f.com/test/mod">error</severity>

### Errors

All functions in `libconfd` signal errors through the return of the
\#defined CONFD_ERR - which has the value -1 - or alternatively
CONFD_EOF (-2) which means that NSO closed its end of the socket.

Data provider callbacks (see [confd_lib_dp(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_dp)) can
also signal errors by returning CONFD_ERR from the callback. This can be
done for all different kinds of callbacks. It is possible to provide
additional error information from one of these callbacks by using one of
the functions:

`confd_trans_seterr(), confd_trans_seterr_extended(), confd_trans_seterr_extended_info()`  
> For transaction callbacks

`confd_db_seterr(), confd_db_seterr_extended(), confd_db_seterr_extended_info()`  
> For db callbacks

`confd_action_seterr(), confd_action_seterr_extended(), confd_action_seterr_extended_info()`  
> For action callbacks

`confd_notification_seterr(), confd_notification_seterr_extended(), confd_notification_seterr_extended_info()`  
> For notification callbacks

CDB two phase subscribers (see [confd_lib_cdb(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_cdb))
can also provide error information when
`cdb_read_subscription_socket2()` has returned with type set to
`CDB_SUB_PREPARE`, using one of the functions `cdb_sub_abort_trans()`
and `cdb_sub_abort_trans_info()`.

Whenever CONFD_ERR is returned from any API function in `libconfd` it is
possible to obtain additional information on the error through the
symbol `confd_errno`. Additionally there may be an error text associated
with the error. A call to the function

    char *confd_lasterr(
    void);

returns a string which contains additional textual information on the
error. Furthermore, the function

    char *confd_strerror(
    int code);

returns a string which describes a particular error code. When one of
the The following error codes are available:

`CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS` (1)

### Miscellaneous

The library will always set the default signal handler for SIGPIPE to be
SIG_IGN. All libconfd APIs are socket based and the library must be able
to detect failed write operations in a controlled manner.

The include file `confd_lib.h` includes `assert.h` and uses assert
macros in the specialized `CONFD_GET_XXX()` macros. If the behavior of
assert is not wanted in a production environment, we can define NDEBUG
before including `confd_lib.h` (or `confd.h`), see assert(3).
Alternatively we can define a `CONFD_ASSERT()` macro before including
`confd_lib.h`. The assert macros are invoked via `CONFD_ASSERT()`, which
is defined by:

<div class="informalexample">

    #ifndef CONFD_ASSERT
    #define CONFD_ASSERT(E) assert(E)
    #endif

</div>

I.e. by defining a different version of `CONFD_ASSERT()`, we can get our
own error handler invoked instead of assert(3), for example:

<div class="informalexample">

    void log_error(char *file, int line, char *expr);

    #define CONFD_ASSERT(E) \
                ((E) ? (void)0 : log_error(__FILE__, __LINE__, #E))

    #include <confd_lib.h>
        

</div>

### Syslog And Debug

When developing applications with `libconfd` we always need to indicate
to the library which verbosity level should be used by the library.
There are three different levels to choose from: CONFD_SILENT where the
library never writes anything, CONFD_DEBUG where the library reports all
errors and finally CONFD_TRACE where the library traces the execution
and invocations of all the various callback functions.

There are two different destinations for all library printouts. When we
call `confd_init()`, we always need to supply a `FILE*` stream which
should be used for all printouts. This parameter can be set to NULL if
we never want any `FILE*` printouts to occur.

The second destination is syslog, i.e. the library will syslog if told
to. This is controlled by the global integer variable
`confd_lib_use_syslog`. If we set this variable to `1`, `libconfd` will
syslog all output. If we set it to `0` the library will not syslog. It
is the responsibility of the application to (optionally) call
`openlog()` before initializing the NSO library. The default value is
`0`.

There also exists a hook point at which a library user can install their
own printer. This done by assigning to a global variable
`confd_user_log_hook`, as in:

<div class="informalexample">

    void mylogger(int syslogprio, const char *fmt, va_list ap) {
        char buf[BUFSIZ];
        sprintf(buf, "MYLOG:(%d) ", syslogprio); strcat(buf, fmt);
        vfprintf(stderr, buf, ap);
    }

    confd_user_log_hook = mylogger;

</div>

The `syslogprio` is LOG_ERR or LOG_CRIT for error messages, and
LOG_DEBUG for trace messages, see the description of `confd_init()`.

Thus a good combination of values in a target environment is to set the
`FILE*` handle to NULL and `confd_lib_use_syslog` to `1`. This way we do
not get the overhead of file logging and at the same time get all errors
reported to syslog.

### Library

NCS Library, (`libconfd`, `-lconfd`)

### Description

The `libconfd` shared library is used to connect to the NSO transaction
manager. The API described in this man page has several purposes. We can
use MAAPI when we wish to implement our own proprietary management
agent. We also use MAAPI to attach to already existing NSO transactions,
for example when we wish to implement semantic validation of
configuration data in C, and also when we wish to implement CLI wizards
in C.

### Paths

The majority of the functions described here take as their two last
arguments a format string and a variable number of extra arguments as
in: `char *` `fmt`, `...``);`

The paths for MAAPI work like paths for CDB (see
[confd_lib_cdb(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_cdb.paths)) with the exception that
the bracket notation '\[n\]' is not allowed for MAAPI paths.

All the functions that take a path on this form also have a `va_list`
variant, of the same form as `maapi_vget_elem()` and
`maapi_vset_elem()`, which are the only ones explicitly documented
below. I.e. they have a prefix "maapi_v" instead of "maapi\_", and take
a single va_list argument instead of a variable number of arguments.

### Functions

All functions return CONFD_OK (0), CONFD_ERR (-1) or CONFD_EOF (-2)
unless otherwise stated. Whenever CONFD_ERR is returned from any API
function in confd_lib_maapi it is possible to obtain additional
information on the error through the symbol `confd_errno`, see the
ERRORS section of [confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib).

In the case of CONFD_EOF it means that the socket to NCS has been
closed.

    int maapi_connect(
    int sock, const struct sockaddr* srv, int srv_sz);

The application has to connect to NCS before it can interact with NCS.

> **Note**  
>  
> If this call fails (i.e. does not return CONFD_OK), the socket
> descriptor must be closed and a new socket created before the call is

    int maapi_load_schemas(
    int sock);

This function dynamically loads schema information from the NSO daemon
into the library, where it is available to all the library components as
described in the [confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) and
[confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib) man pages. See also
`confd_load_schemas()` in [confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib).

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

    int maapi_load_schemas_list(
    int sock, int flags, const uint32_t *nshash, const int *nsflags, int num_ns);

A variant of `maapi_load_schemas()` that allows for loading a subset of
the schema information from the NSO daemon into the library. This means
that the loading can be significantly faster in the case of a system
with many large data models, with the drawback that the functions that
use the schema information will have limited functionality or not work
at all.

The `flags` parameter can be given as `CONFD_LOAD_SCHEMA_HASH` to
request that the global mapping between strings and hash values for the
data model nodes should be loaded. If `flags` is given as 0, this
mapping is not loaded. The mapping is required for use of the functions
`confd_hash2str()`, `confd_str2hash()`, `confd_cs_node_cd()`, and
`confd_xpath_pp_kpath()`. Additionally, without the mapping,
`confd_pp_value()`, `confd_pp_kpath()`, and `confd_pp_kpath_len()`, as
well as the trace printouts from the library, will print nodes as
"tag\<N\>", where N is the hash value, instead of the node name.

The `nshash` parameter is a `num_ns` elements long array of namespace
hash values, requesting that schema information should be loaded for the
listed namespaces according to the corresponding element of the
`nsflags` array (also `num_ns` elements long). For each namespace,
either or both of these flags may be given:

`CONFD_LOAD_SCHEMA_NODES`  
> This flag requests that the `confd_cs_node` tree (see
> [confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types)) for the namespace should be
> loaded. This tree is required for the use of the functions
> `confd_find_cs_root()`, `confd_find_cs_node()`,
> `confd_find_cs_node_child()`, `confd_cs_node_cd()`,
> `confd_register_node_type()`, `confd_get_leaf_list_type()`, and
> `confd_xpath_pp_kpath()` for the namespace. Additionally, the above
> functions that print a `confd_hkeypath_t`, as well as the library
> trace printouts, will attempt to use this tree and the type
> information (see below) to find the correct string representation for
> key values - if the tree isn't available, key values will be printed
> as described for `confd_pp_value()`.

`CONFD_LOAD_SCHEMA_TYPES`  
> This flag requests that information about the types defined in the
> namespace should be loaded. The type information is required for use
> of the functions `confd_val2str()`, `confd_str2val()`,
> `confd_find_ns_type()`, `confd_get_leaf_list_type()`,
> `confd_register_ns_type()`, and `confd_register_node_type()` for the
> namespace. Additionally the `confd_hkeypath_t`-printing functions and
> the library trace printouts will also fall back to `confd_pp_value()`
> as described above if the type information isn't available.
>
> Type definitions may refer to types defined in other namespaces. If
> the `CONFD_LOAD_SCHEMA_TYPES` flag has been given for a namespace, and
> the types defined there have such type references to namespaces that
> are not included in the `nshash` array, the referenced type
> information will also be loaded, if necessary recursively, until the
> types have a complete definition.

See also `confd_load_schemas_list()` in
[confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib).

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

    int maapi_get_schema_file_path(
    int sock, char **buf);

If shared memory schema support has been enabled via
/ncs-config/enable-shared-memory-schema in `ncs.conf`, this function
will return the pathname of the file used for the shared memory mapping,
which can then be passed to `confd_mmap_schemas()` (see
[confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib)). If the call is successful,
`buf` is set to point to a dynamically allocated string, which must be
freed by the application by means of calling `free(3)`.

If creation of the schema file is in progress when the function is
called, the call will block until the creation has completed. If shared
memory schema support has not been enabled, or if the creation of the
schema file failed, the function returns CONFD_ERR with `confd_errno`
set to CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_close(
    int sock);

Effectively a call to `maapi_end_user_session()` and also closes the
socket.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION

Even if the call returns an error, the socket will be closed.

### Session Management

    int maapi_start_user_session(
    int sock, const char *username, const char *context, const char **groups, 
    int numgroups, const struct confd_ip *src_addr, enum confd_proto prot);

Once we have created a MAAPI socket, we must also establish a user
session on the socket. It is up to the user of the MAAPI library to
authenticate users. The library user can ask NCS to perform the actual
authentication through a call to `maapi_authenticate()` but
authentication may very well occur through some other external means.

Thus, when we use this function to create a user session, we must
provide all relevant information about the user. If we wish to execute
read/write transactions over the MAAPI interface, we must first have an
established user session.

A user session corresponds to a NETCONF manager who has just established
an authenticated SSH connection, but not yet sent any NETCONF commands
on the SSH connection.

The `struct confd_ip` is defined in `confd_lib.h` and must be properly
populated before the call. For example:

<div class="informalexample">

    struct confd_ip ip;
    ip.af = AF_INET;
    inet_aton("10.0.0.33", &ip.ip.v4);

</div>

The `context` parameter can be any string. The string provided here is
precisely the context string which will be used to authorize all data
access through the AAA system. Each AAA rule has a context string which
must match in order for a AAA rule to match. (See the AAA chapter in the
User Guide.)

Using the string "system" for `context` has special significance:

- The session is exempt from all maxSessions limits in confd.conf.

- There will be no authorization checks done by the AAA system.

- The session is not logged in the audit log.

- The session is not shown in 'show users' in CLI etc.

- The session may be started already in NCS start phase 0. (However
  read-write transactions can not be started until phase 1, i.e.
  transactions started in phase 0 must use parameter `readwrite` ==
  `CONFD_READ`).

Thus this can be useful e.g. when we need to create the user session for
an "internal" transaction done by an application, without relation to a
session from a northbound agent. Of course the implications of the above
need to be carefully considered in each case.

It is not possible to create new user sessions until NSO has reached
start phase 2 (See [confd(1)](section1.md#ncs)), with the above exception of
a session with the context set to "system".

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_ALREADY_EXISTS,

    int maapi_start_user_session2(
    int sock, const char *username, const char *context, const char **groups, 
    int numgroups, const struct confd_ip *src_addr, int src_port, enum confd_proto prot);

This function does the same as `maapi_start_user_session()`, but allows
for the TCP/UDP source port to be passed to NCS. Calling
`maapi_start_user_session()` is equivalent to calling
`maapi_start_user_session2()` with `src_port` 0.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_ALREADY_EXISTS,

    int maapi_start_user_session3(
    int sock, const char *username, const char *context, const char **groups, 
    int numgroups, const struct confd_ip *src_addr, int src_port, enum confd_proto prot, 
    const char *vendor, const char *product, const char *version, const char *client_id);

This function does the same as `maapi_start_user_session2()`, but allows
additional information about the session to be passed to NCS. Calling
`maapi_start_user_session2()` is equivalent to calling
`maapi_start_user_session3()` with `vendor`, `product` and `version` set
to NULL, and `client_id` set to \_\_MAAPI_CLIENT_ID\_\_. The
\_\_MAAPI_CLIENT_ID\_\_ macro (defined in confd_maapi.h) will expand to
a string representation of \_\_FILE\_\_:\_\_LINE\_\_.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_ALREADY_EXISTS,
CONFD_ERR_BADSTATE

    int maapi_end_user_session(
    int sock);

Ends our own user session. If the MAAPI socket is closed, the user
session is automatically ended.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION

    int maapi_kill_user_session(
    int sock, int usessid);

Kill the user session identified by `usessid`.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_get_user_sessions(
    int sock, int res[], int n);

Get the usessid for all current user sessions. The `res` array is
populated with at most `n` usessids, and the total number of user
sessions is returned (i.e. if the return value is larger than `n`, the
array was too short to hold all usessids).

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

    int maapi_get_user_session(
    int sock, int usessid, struct confd_user_info *us);

Populate the `confd_user_info` structure with the data for the user
session identified by `usessid`.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_get_my_user_session_id(
    int sock);

A user session is identified through an integer index, a usessid. This
function returns the usessid associated with the MAAPI socket `sock`.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_set_user_session(
    int sock, int usessid);

Associate the socket with an already existing user session. This can be
used instead of `maapi_start_user_session()` when we really do not want
to start a new user session, e.g. if we want to call an action on behalf
of a given user session.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_get_user_session_identification(
    int sock, int usessid, struct confd_user_identification *uident);

If the flag `CONFD_USESS_FLAG_HAS_IDENTIFICATION` is set in the `flags`
field of the `confd_user_info` structure, additional identification
information has been provided by the northbound client. This information
can then be retrieved into a `confd_user_identification` structure (see
`confd_lib.h`) by calling this function. The elements of
`confd_user_identification` are either NULL (if the corresponding
information was not provided) or point to a string. The strings must be
freed by the application by means of calling `free(3)`.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_get_user_session_opaque(
    int sock, int usessid, char **opaque);

If the flag `CONFD_USESS_FLAG_HAS_OPAQUE` is set in the `flags` field of
the `confd_user_info` structure, "opaque" information has been provided
by the northbound client (see the `-O` option in
[confd_cli(1)](section1.md#confd_cli)). The information can then be retrieved
by calling this function. If the call is successful, `opaque` is set to
point to a dynamically allocated string, which must be freed by the
application by means of calling `free(3)`.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_get_authorization_info(
    int sock, int usessid, struct confd_authorization_info **ainfo);

This function retrieves authorization info for a user session, i.e. the
groups that the user has been assigned to. The
`struct confd_authorization_info` is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_authorization_info {
    int ngroups;
    char **groups;
};
```

</div>

If the call is successful, `ainfo` is set to point to a dynamically
allocated structure, which must be freed by the application by means of
calling `confd_free_authorization_info()` (see
[confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib)) .

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_set_next_user_session_id(
    int sock, int usessid);

Set the user session id that will be assigned to the next user session
started. The given value is silently forced to be in the range 100 ..
2^31-1. This function can be used to ensure that session ids for user
sessions started by northbound agents or via MAAPI are unique across a
NCS restart.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

### Locks

    int maapi_lock(
    int sock, enum confd_dbname name);

    int maapi_unlock(
    int sock, enum confd_dbname name);

These functions can be used to manipulate locks on the 3 different
database types. If `maapi_lock()` is called and the database is already
locked, CONFD_ERR is returned, and `confd_errno` will be set to
CONFD_ERR_LOCKED. If `confd_errno` is CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL it means that a
callback has been invoked in an external database to lock/unlock which
in its turn returned an error. (See
[confd_lib_dp(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_dp) for external database callback
API)

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_LOCKED,
CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION

    int maapi_is_lock_set(
    int sock, enum confd_dbname name);

Returns a positive integer being the usid of the current lock owner if
the lock is set, and 0 if the lock is not set.

    int maapi_lock_partial(
    int sock, enum confd_dbname name, char *xpaths[], int nxpaths, int *lockid);

    int maapi_unlock_partial(
    int sock, int lockid);

We can also manipulate partial locks on the databases, i.e. locks on a
specified set of leafs and/or subtrees. The specification of what to
lock is given via the `xpaths` array, which is populated with `nxpaths`
pointers to XPath expressions. If the lock succeeds,
`maapi_lock_partial()` returns CONFD_OK, and a lock identifier to use
with `maapi_unlock_partial()` is stored in `*lockid`.

If CONFD_ERR is returned, some values of `confd_errno` are of particular
interest:

CONFD_ERR_LOCKED  
> Some of the requested nodes are already locked.

CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL  
> A callback has been invoked in an external database to
> lock_partial/unlock_partial which in its turn returned an error (see
> [confd_lib_dp(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_dp) for external database callback
> API).

CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS  
> The list of XPath expressions evaluated to an empty set of nodes -
> i.e. there is nothing to lock.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_LOCKED,
CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

### Candidate Manipulation

All the candidate manipulation functions require that the candidate data
store is enabled in `confd.conf` - otherwise they will set `confd_errno`
to CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS. If the candidate data store is enabled,
`confd_errno` may be set to CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS for other reasons, as
described below.

All these functions may also set `confd_errno` to CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL.
This value can only be set when the candidate is owned by the external
database. When NCS owns the candidate, which is the most common
configuration scenario, the candidate manipulation function will never
set `confd_errno` to CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL.

    int maapi_candidate_validate(
    int sock);

This function validates the candidate. The function should only be used
when the candidate is not owned by NCS, i.e. when the candidate is owned
by an external database.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL

    int maapi_candidate_commit(
    int sock);

This function copies the candidate to running. It is also used to
confirm a previous call to `maapi_candidate_confirmed_commit()`, i.e. to
prevent the automatic rollback if a confirmed commit is not confirmed.

If `confd_errno` is CONFD_ERR_INUSE it means that some other user
session is doing a confirmed commit or has a lock on the database.
CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS means that there is an ongoing persistent confirmed
commit (see below) - i.e. there is no confirmed commit that this
function call can apply to.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS,
CONFD_ERR_INUSE, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION, CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL

    int maapi_candidate_confirmed_commit(
    int sock, int timeoutsecs);

This function also copies the candidate into running. However if a call
to `maapi_candidate_commit()` is not done within `timeoutsecs` an
automatic rollback will occur. It can also be used to "extend" a
confirmed commit that is already in progress, i.e. set a new timeout or
add changes.

If `confd_errno` is CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS it means that there is an ongoing
persistent confirmed commit (see below).

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS,
CONFD_ERR_INUSE, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION, CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL

    int maapi_candidate_abort_commit(
    int sock);

This function cancels an ongoing confirmed commit.

If `confd_errno` is CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS it means that some other user
session initiated the confirmed commit, or that there is an ongoing
persistent confirmed commit (see below).

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS,
CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION, CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL

    int maapi_candidate_confirmed_commit_persistent(
    int sock, int timeoutsecs, const char *persist, const char *persist_id);

This function can be used to start or extend a persistent confirmed
commit. The `persist` parameter sets the cookie for the persistent
confirmed commit, while the `persist_id` gives the cookie for an already
ongoing persistent confirmed commit. This gives the following
possibilities:

`persist` = "cookie", `persist_id` = NULL  
> Start a persistent confirmed commit with the cookie "cookie", or
> extend an already ongoing non-persistent confirmed commit and turn it
> into a persistent confirmed commit.

`persist` = "newcookie", `persist_id` = "oldcookie"  
> Extend an ongoing persistent confirmed commit that uses the cookie
> "oldcookie" and change the cookie to "newcookie".

`persist` = NULL, `persist_id` = "cookie"  
> Extend an ongoing persistent confirmed commit that uses the cookie
> "oldcookie" and turn it into a non-persistent confirmed commit.

`persist` = NULL, `persist_id` = NULL  
> Does the same as `maapi_candidate_confirmed_commit()`.

Typical usage is to start a persistent confirmed commit with `persist` =
"cookie", `persist_id` = NULL, and to extend it with `persist` =
"cookie", `persist_id` = "cookie".

If `confd_errno` is CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS it means that there is an ongoing
persistent confirmed commit, but `persist_id` didn't give the right
cookie for it.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS,
CONFD_ERR_INUSE, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION, CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL

    int maapi_candidate_confirmed_commit_info(
    int sock, int timeoutsecs, const char *persist, const char *persist_id, 
    const char *label, const char *comment);

This function does the same as
`maapi_candidate_confirmed_commit_persistent()`, but allows for setting
the "Label" and/or "Comment" that is stored in the rollback file when
the candidate is committed to running. To set only the "Label", give
`comment` as NULL, and to set only the "Comment", give `label` as NULL.
If both `label` and `comment` are NULL, the function does exactly the
same as `maapi_candidate_confirmed_commit_persistent()`.

> **Note**  
>  
> To ensure that the "Label" and/or "Comment" are stored in the rollback
> file in all cases when doing a confirmed commit, they must be given
> both with the confirmed commit (using this function) and with the
> confirming commit (using `maapi_candidate_commit_info()`).

If `confd_errno` is CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS it means that there is an ongoing
persistent confirmed commit, but `persist_id` didn't give the right
cookie for it.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS,
CONFD_ERR_INUSE, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION, CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL

    int maapi_candidate_commit_persistent(
    int sock, const char *persist_id);

Confirm an ongoing persistent confirmed commit with the cookie given by
`persist_id`. If `persist_id` is NULL, it does the same as
`maapi_candidate_commit()`.

If `confd_errno` is CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS it means that there is an ongoing
persistent confirmed commit, but `persist_id` didn't give the right
cookie for it.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS,
CONFD_ERR_INUSE, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION, CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL

    int maapi_candidate_commit_info(
    int sock, const char *persist_id, const char *label, const char *comment);

This function does the same as `maapi_candidate_commit_persistent()`,
but allows for setting the "Label" and/or "Comment" that is stored in
the rollback file when the candidate is committed to running. To set
only the "Label", give `comment` as NULL, and to set only the "Comment",
give `label` as NULL. If both `label` and `comment` are NULL, the
function does exactly the same as `maapi_candidate_commit_persistent()`.

> **Note**  
>  
> To ensure that the "Label" and/or "Comment" are stored in the rollback
> file in all cases when doing a confirmed commit, they must be given
> both with the confirmed commit (using
> `maapi_candidate_confirmed_commit_info()`) and with the confirming
> commit (using this function).

If `confd_errno` is CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS it means that there is an ongoing
persistent confirmed commit, but `persist_id` didn't give the right
cookie for it.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS,
CONFD_ERR_INUSE, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION, CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL

    int maapi_candidate_abort_commit_persistent(
    int sock, const char *persist_id);

Cancel an ongoing persistent confirmed commit with the cookie given by
`persist_id`. (If `persist_id` is NULL, it does the same as
`maapi_candidate_abort_commit()`.)

If `confd_errno` is CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS it means that there is an ongoing
persistent confirmed commit, but `persist_id` didn't give the right
cookie for it.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS,
CONFD_ERR_INUSE, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION, CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL

    int maapi_candidate_reset(
    int sock);

This function copies running into candidate.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_INUSE,
CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION

    int maapi_confirmed_commit_in_progress(
    int sock);

Checks whether a confirmed commit is ongoing. Returns a positive integer
being the usid of confirmed commit operation in progress or 0 if no
confirmed commit is in progress.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

    int maapi_copy_running_to_startup(
    int sock);

This function copies running to startup.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_INUSE,
CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_is_running_modified(
    int sock);

Returns 1 if running has been modified since the last copy to startup, 0
if it has not been modified.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_is_candidate_modified(
    int sock);

Returns 1 if candidate has been modified, i.e if there are any
outstanding non committed changes to the candidate, 0 if no changes are
done

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

### Transaction Control

    int maapi_start_trans(
    int sock, enum confd_dbname name, enum confd_trans_mode readwrite);

The main purpose of MAAPI is to provide read and write access into the
NCS transaction manager. Regardless of whether data is kept in CDB or in
some (or several) external data bases, the same API is used to access
data. ConfD acts as a mediator and multiplexes the different commands to
the code which is responsible for each individual data node.

This function creates a new transaction towards the data store specified
by `name`, which can be one of `CONFD_CANDIDATE`, `CONFD_OPERATIONAL`,
`CONFD_RUNNING`, or `CONFD_STARTUP` (however updating the startup data
store is better done via `maapi_copy_running_to_startup()`). The
`readwrite` parameter can be either `CONFD_READ`, to start a readonly
transaction, or `CONFD_READ_WRITE`, to start a read-write transaction.

A readonly transaction will incur less resource usage, thus if no writes
will be done (e.g. the purpose of the transaction is only to read
operational data), it is best to use `CONFD_READ`. There are also some
cases where starting a read-write transaction is not allowed, e.g. if we
start a transaction towards the running data store and
/confdConfig/datastores/running/access is set to
"writable-through-candidate" in `confd.conf`, or if ConfD is running in
HA secondary mode.

If start of the transaction is successful, the function returns a new
transaction handle, a non-negative integer `thandle` which must be used
as a parameter in all API functions which manipulate the transaction.

We will drive this transaction forward through the different states a
ConfD transaction goes through. See the ascii arts in
[confd_lib_dp(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_dp) for a picture of these states. If
an external database is used, and it has registered callback functions
for the different transaction states, those callbacks will be called
when we in MAAPI invoke the different MAAPI transaction manipulation
functions. For example when we call `maapi_start_trans()` the `init()`
callback will be invoked in all external databases. (However ConfD may
delay the actual invocation of `init()` as an optimization, see
[confd_lib_dp(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_dp).) If data is kept in CDB, ConfD
will handle everything internally.

    int maapi_start_trans2(
    int sock, enum confd_dbname name, enum confd_trans_mode readwrite, int usid);

If we want to start new transactions inside actions, we can use this
function to execute the new transaction within the existing user
session. It is equivalent to calling `maapi_set_user_session()` and then
`maapi_start_trans()`.

    int maapi_start_trans_flags(
    int sock, enum confd_dbname name, enum confd_trans_mode readwrite, int usid, 
    int flags);

This function makes it possible to set the flags that can otherwise be
used with `maapi_set_flags()` already when starting a transaction, as
well as setting the `MAAPI_FLAG_HIDE_INACTIVE`,
`MAAPI_FLAG_HIDE_ALL_HIDEGROUPS` and `MAAPI_FLAG_DELAYED_WHEN` flags
that can only be used with `maapi_start_trans_flags()`. See the
description of `maapi_set_flags()` for the available flags. It also
incorporates the functionality of `maapi_start_trans()` and
`maapi_start_trans2()` with respect to user sessions: If `usid` is 0,
the transaction will be started within the user session associated with
the MAAPI socket (like `maapi_start_trans()`), otherwise it will be
started within the user session given by `usid` (like
`maapi_start_trans2()`).

    int flags, const char *vendor, const char *product, const char *version, 
    const char *client_id);

This function does the same as `maapi_start_trans_flags()` but allows
additional information about the transaction to be passed to NCS.
Calling `maapi_start_trans_flags()` is equivalent to calling
`maapi_start_trans_flags2()` with `vendor`, `product` and `version` set
to NULL, and `client_id` set to \_\_MAAPI_CLIENT_ID\_\_. The
\_\_MAAPI_CLIENT_ID\_\_ macro (defined in confd_maapi.h) will expand to
a string representation of \_\_FILE\_\_:\_\_LINE\_\_.

    int maapi_start_trans_in_trans(
    int sock, enum confd_trans_mode readwrite, int usid, int thandle);

This function makes it possible to start a transaction with another
transaction as backend, instead of an actual data store. This can be
useful if we want to make a set of related changes, and then either
apply or discard them all based on some criterion, while other changes
remain unaffected. The `thandle` identifies the backend transaction to
use. If `usid` is 0, the transaction will be started within the user
session associated with the MAAPI socket, otherwise it will be started
within the user session given by `usid`. If we call
`maapi_apply_trans()` for this "transaction in a transaction", the
changes (if any) will be applied to the backend transaction. To discard
the changes, call `maapi_finish_trans()` without calling
`maapi_apply_trans()` first.

The changes in this transaction can be validated by calling
`maapi_validate_trans()` with a non-zero value for `forcevalidation`,
but calling `maapi_apply_trans()` will not do any validation - in either
case, the resulting configuration will be validated when the backend
transaction is committed to the running data store. Note though that
unlike the case with a transaction directly towards a data store, no
transaction lock is taken on the underlying data store when doing
validation of this type of transaction - thus it is possible for the
contents of the data store to change (due to commit of another
transaction) during the validation.

    int maapi_finish_trans(
    int sock, int thandle);

This will finish the transaction. If the transaction is implemented by
an external database, this will invoke the `finish()` callback.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

The error CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS is set for all API functions which use a
`thandle`, the return value from `maapi_start_trans()`, whenever no
transaction is started.

    int maapi_validate_trans(
    int sock, int thandle, int unlock, int forcevalidation);

This function validates all data written in the transaction. This
includes all data model constraints and all defined semantic validation
in C, i.e. user programs that have registered functions under validation
points.

If this function returns CONFD_ERR, the transaction is open for further
editing. There are two special `confd_errno` values which are of
particular interest here.

CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL  
> this means that an external validation program in C returns CONFD_ERR
> i.e. that the semantic validation failed. The reason for the failure
> can be found in `confd_lasterr()`

CONFD_ERR_VALIDATION_WARNING  
> This means that an external semantic validation program in C returned
> CONFD_VALIDATION_WARN. The string `confd_lasterr()` is organized as a
> series of NUL terminated strings as in
> `keypath1, reason1, keypath2, reason2 ...` where the sequence is
> terminated with an additional NUL

If `unlock` is 1, the transaction is open for further editing even if
validation succeeds. If `unlock` is 0 and the function returns CONFD_OK,
the next function to be called MUST be `maapi_prepare_trans()` or
`maapi_finish_trans()`.

`unlock` = 1 can be used to implement a 'validate' command which can be
given in the middle of an editing session. The first thing that happens
is that a lock is set. If `unlock` == 1, the lock is released on
success. The lock is always released on failure.

The `forcevalidation` parameter should normally be 0. It has no effect
for a transaction towards the running or startup data stores, validation
is always performed. For a transaction towards the candidate data store,
validation will not be done unless `forcevalidation` is non-zero.
Avoiding this validation is preferable if we are going to commit the
candidate to running (e.g. with `maapi_candidate_commit()`), since
otherwise the validation will be done twice. However if we are
implementing a 'validate' command, we should give a non-zero value for
`forcevalidation`.

    int maapi_prepare_trans(
    int sock, int thandle);

This function must be called as first part of two-phase commit. After
this function has been called `maapi_commit_trans()` or
`maapi_abort_trans()` must be called.

It will invoke the prepare callback in all participants in the
transaction. If all participants reply with CONFD_OK, the second phase
of the two-phase commit procedure is commenced.

    int maapi_commit_trans(

    int maapi_abort_trans(

Finally at the last stage, either commit or abort must be called. A call
to one of these functions must also eventually be followed by a call to
`maapi_finish_trans()` which will terminate the transaction.

    int maapi_apply_trans(
    int sock, int thandle, int keepopen);

Invoking the above transaction functions in exactly the right order can
be a bit complicated. The right order to invoke the functions is
`maapi_validate_trans()`, `maapi_prepare_trans()`,
`maapi_commit_trans()` (or `maapi_abort_trans()`). Usually we do not
require this fine grained control over the two-phase commit protocol. It
is easier to use `maapi_apply_trans()` which validates, prepares and
eventually commits or aborts.

A call to `maapi_apply_trans()` must also eventually be followed by a
call to `maapi_finish_trans()` which will terminate the transaction.

The parameter `keepopen` can optionally be set to `1`, then the changes
to the transaction are not discarded if validation fails. This feature
is typically used by management applications that wish to present the
validation errors to an operator and allow the operator to fix the
validation errors and then later retry the apply sequence.

    int sock, int thandle, int keepopen, confd_tag_value_t *params, int nparams, 
    confd_tag_value_t **values, int *nvalues);

This is the version of `maapi_apply_trans()` for NCS which allows to
pass commit parameters in form of *Tagged Value Array* according to the
input parameters for `rpc prepare-transaction` as defined in
`tailf-netconf-ncs.yang` module.

The function will populate the `values` array with the result of
applying transaction. The result follows the model for the output
parameters for `rpc prepare-transaction` (if dry-run was requested) or
the output parameters for `rpc commit-transaction` as defined in
`tailf-netconf-ncs.yang` module. If the list of result values is empty,
then `nvalues` will be 0 and `values` will be NULL.

Just like with `maapi_apply_trans()`, the call to
`maapi_ncs_apply_trans_params()` must be followed by the call to
`maapi_finish_trans()`. It is also only applicable to read-write
transactions.

If any attribute values are returned (`*nvalues` \> 0), the caller must
free the allocated memory by calling `confd_free_value()` for each of
the `confd_value_t` elements, and `free(3)` for the `*values` array
itself.

    int maapi_ncs_get_trans_params(

This function will return the current commit parameters for the given
transaction. The function will populate the `values` array with the
commit parameters in the form of *Tagged Value Array* according to the
input parameters for `rpc prepare-transaction` as defined in the
`tailf-netconf-ncs.yang` module.

If any attribute values are returned (`*nvalues` \> 0), the caller must
free the allocated memory by calling `confd_free_value()` for each of

After successfully invoking `maapi_commit_trans()`
`maapi_get_rollback_id()` can be used to retrieve the fixed rollback id
generated for this commit.

If a rollback id was generated a non-negative rollback id is returned.
If rollbacks are disabled or no rollback was created -1 is returned.

### Read/Write Functions

    int maapi_set_namespace(
    int sock, int thandle, int hashed_ns);

If we want to read or write data where the toplevel element name is not
unique, we must indicate which namespace we are going to use. It is
possible to change the namespace several times during a transaction.

The `hashed_ns` integer is the integer which is defined for the
namespace in the .h file which is generated by the 'confdc' compiler. It
is also possible to indicate which namespace to use through the
namespace prefix when we read and write data. Thus the path /foo:bar/baz
will get us /bar/baz in the namespace with prefix "foo" regardless of
what the "set" namespace is. And if there is only one toplevel element
called "bar" across all namespaces, we can use /bar/baz without the
prefix and without calling `maapi_set_namespace()`.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_cd(
    int sock, int thandle, const char *fmt, ...);

This function mimics the behavior of the UNIX "cd" command. It changes
our working position in the data tree. If we are worried about
performance, it is more efficient to invoke `maapi_cd()` to some
position in the tree and there perform a series of operations using
relative paths than it is to perform the equivalent series of operations
using absolute paths. Note that this function can not be used as an
existence test.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_BADPATH, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_pushd(
    int sock, int thandle, const char *fmt, ...);

Behaves like `maapi_cd()` with the exception that we can subsequently
call `maapi_popd()` and returns to the previous position in the data
tree.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_BADPATH, CONFD_ERR_NOSTACK, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_popd(
    int sock, int thandle);

Pops the top position of the directory stack and changes directory.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_BADPATH, CONFD_ERR_NOSTACK, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_getcwd(
    int sock, int thandle, size_t strsz, char *curdir);

Returns the current position as previously set by `maapi_cd()`,
`maapi_pushd()`, or `maapi_popd()` as a string. Note that what is
returned is a pretty-printed version of the internal representation of
the current position, it will be the shortest unique way to print the
path but it might not exactly match the string given to `maapi_cd()`.
The buffer in \*curdir will be NULL terminated, and no more characters
than strsz-1 will be written to it.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_getcwd2(
    int sock, int thandle, size_t *strsz, char *curdir);

Same as `maapi_getcwd()` but \*strsz will be updated to full length of
the path on success.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_getcwd_kpath(
    int sock, int thandle, confd_hkeypath_t **kp);

Returns the current position like `maapi_getcwd()`, but as a pointer to
a hashed keypath instead of as a string. The hkeypath is dynamically
allocated, and may further contain dynamically allocated elements. The
caller must free the allocated memory, easiest done by calling
`confd_free_hkeypath()`.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_exists(
    int sock, int thandle, const char *fmt, ...);

Return 1 if the path refers to an existing node in the data tree, 0 if
it does not, and CONFD_ERR if something goes wrong.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_BADPATH, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS, CONFD_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED

    int sock, int thandle, const char *fmt, ...);

Returns the number of entries for a list in the data tree.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_BADPATH, CONFD_ERR_UNAVAILABLE, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS,
CONFD_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED

    int maapi_get_elem(
    int sock, int thandle, confd_value_t *v, const char *fmt, ...);

This function reads a value from the path in `fmt` and writes the result
into the result parameter `confd_value_t`. The path must lead to a leaf
node in the data tree. Note that for the C_BUF, C_BINARY, C_LIST,
C_OBJECTREF, C_OID, C_QNAME, C_HEXSTR, and C_BITBIG `confd_value_t`
types, the buffer(s) pointed to are allocated using malloc(3) - it is up
to the user of this interface to free them using `confd_free_value()`.

The maapi interface also contains a long list of access functions that
accompany the `maapi_get_elem()` function which is a general access
function that returns a `confd_value_t`. The accompanying functions all
have the format `maapi_get_<type>_elem()` where \<type\> is one of the
actual C types a `confd_value_t` can have. For example the function:

<div class="informalexample">

    maapi_get_int64_elem(int sock, int thandle, int64_t *rval,
                                    const char *fmt, ...);

</div>

is used to read a signed 64 bit integer. It fills in the provided
`int64_t` parameter. This corresponds to the YANG datatype int64, see
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types). Similar access functions are
provided for all the different builtin types.

One access function that needs additional explaining is the
`maapi_get_str_elem()`. This function copies at most `n-1` characters
into a user provided buffer, and terminates the string with a NUL
character. If the buffer is not sufficiently large CONFD_ERR is
returned, and `confd_errno` is set to CONFD_ERR_PROTOUSAGE. Note it is
always possible to use maapi_get_elem() to get hold of the
`confd_value_t`, which in the case of a string buffer contains the
length.

This function does the same as `maapi_get_elem()`, but takes a single
`va_list` argument instead of a variable number of arguments - i.e.
similar to `vprintf()`. Corresponding `va_list` variants exist for all
the functions that take a path as a variable number of arguments.

    int maapi_init_cursor(
    int sock, int thandle, struct maapi_cursor *mc, const char *fmt, ...);

Whenever we wish to iterate over the entries in a list in the data tree,
we must first initialize a cursor. The cursor is subsequently used in a
while loop.

For example if we have:

<div class="informalexample">

    container servers {
      list server {
        key name;
        max-elements 64;
        leaf name {
          type string;
        }
        leaf ip {
          type inet:ip-address;
        }
        leaf port {
          type inet:port-number;
          mandatory true;
        }
      }
    }

</div>

We can have the following C code which iterates over all server entries.

When a `tailf:secondary-index` statement is used in the data model (see
[tailf_yang_extensions(5)](section5.md#tailf_yang_extensions)), we can set
the `secondary_index` element of the `struct maapi_cursor` to indicate
the name of a chosen secondary index - this must be done after the call
to `maapi_init_cursor()` (which sets `secondary_index` to NULL) and
before any call to `maapi_get_next()`, `maapi_get_objects()` or
`maapi_find_next()`. In this case, `secondary_index` must point to a
NUL-terminated string that is valid throughout the iteration.

> **Note**  
>  
> ConfD will not sort the uncommitted rows. In this particular case,
> setting the `secondary_index` element will not work.

The list can be filtered by setting the `xpath_expr` field of the
`struct maapi_cursor` to an XPath expression - this must be done after
the call to `maapi_init_cursor()` (which sets `xpath_expr` to NULL) and
before any call to `maapi_get_next()` or `maapi_get_objects()`. The
XPath expression is evaluated for each list entry, and if it evaluates
to true, the list entry is returned in `maapi_get_next`. For example, we
can filter the list above on the port number:

<div class="informalexample">

    mc.xpath_expr = "port < 1024";

</div>

    int maapi_get_next(
    struct maapi_cursor *mc);

Iterates and gets the keys for the next entry in a list. The key(s) can
be used to retrieve further data. The key(s) are stored as
`confd_value_t` structures in an array inside the `struct maapi_cursor`.
The array of keys will be deallocated by the library.

For example to read the port leaf from an entry in the server list
above, we would do:

<div class="informalexample">

    ....
    maapi_init_cursor(sock, th, &mc, "/servers/server");
    maapi_get_next(&mc);
    while (mc.n != 0) {
       confd_value_t v;
       maapi_get_elem(sock, th, &v, "/servers/server{%x}/port", &mc.keys[0]);
       ....
       maapi_get_next(&mc);
    }

</div>

The '%\*x' modifier (see the PATHS section in
[confd_lib_cdb(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_cdb.paths)) is especially useful
when working with a maapi cursor. The example above assumes that we know
that the /servers/server list has exactly one key. But we can
alternatively write
`maapi_get_elem(sock, th, &v, "/servers/server{%*x}/port", mc.n, mc.keys);` -
which works regardless of the number of keys that the list has.

    int maapi_find_next(
    struct maapi_cursor *mc, enum confd_find_next_type type, confd_value_t *inkeys, 
    int n_inkeys);

Update the cursor `mc` with the key(s) for the list entry designated by
the `type` and `inkeys` parameters. This function may be used to start a
traversal from an arbitrary entry in a list. Keys for subsequent entries
may be retrieved with the `maapi_get_next()` function.

The `inkeys` array is populated with `n_inkeys` values that designate
the starting point in the list. Normally the array is populated with key
values for the list, but if the `secondary_index` element of the cursor
has been set, the array must instead be populated with values for the
corresponding secondary index-leafs. The `type` can have one of two
values:

`CONFD_FIND_NEXT`  
> The keys for the first list entry *after* the one indicated by the
> `inkeys` array are requested. The `inkeys` array does not have to
> correspond to an actual existing list entry. Furthermore the number of
> values provided in the array (`n_inkeys`) may be fewer than the number
> of keys (or number of index-leafs for a secondary-index) in the data
> model, possibly even zero. This indicates that only the first
> `n_inkeys` values are provided, and the remaining ones should be taken
> to have a value "earlier" than the value for any existing list entry.

`CONFD_FIND_SAME_OR_NEXT`  
> If the values in the `inkeys` array completely identify an actual
> existing list entry, the keys for this entry are requested. Otherwise
> the same logic as described for `CONFD_FIND_NEXT` is used.

The following example will traverse the server list starting with the
first entry (if any) that has a key value that is after "smtp" in the
list order:

<div class="informalexample">

    ....
    confd_value_t inkeys[1];

    maapi_init_cursor(sock, th, &mc, "/servers/server");
    CONFD_SET_STR(&inkeys[0], "smtp");

    maapi_find_next(&mc, CONFD_FIND_NEXT, inkeys, 1);
    while (mc.n != 0) {
       confd_value_t v;
       maapi_get_elem(sock, th, &v, "/servers/server{%x}/port", &mc.keys[0]);
       ....
       maapi_get_next(&mc);
    }

</div>

The field `xpath_expr` in the cursor has no effect on
`maapi_find_next()`.

    void maapi_destroy_cursor(
    struct maapi_cursor *mc);

Deallocates memory which is associated with the cursor.

    int maapi_set_elem(
    int sock, int thandle, confd_value_t *v, const char *fmt, ...);

    int maapi_set_elem2(
    int sock, int thandle, const char *strval, const char *fmt, ...);

We have two different functions to set values. One where the value is a
string and one where the value to set is a `confd_value_t`. The string
version is useful when we have implemented a management agent where the
user enters values as strings. The version with `confd_value_t` is
useful when we are setting values which we have just read.

Another note which might effect users is that if the type we are writing
is any of the encrypt or hash types, the `maapi_set_elem2()` will
perform the asymmetric conversion of values whereas the
`maapi_set_elem()` will not. See [confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types),
the types `tailf:md5-digest-string`, `tailf:des3-cbc-encrypted-string`,
`tailf:aes-cfb-128-encrypted-string` and

    int maapi_vset_elem(
    int sock, int thandle, confd_value_t *v, const char *fmt, va_list args);

This function does the same as `maapi_set_elem()`, but takes a single
`va_list` argument instead of a variable number of arguments - i.e.
similar to `vprintf()`. Corresponding `va_list` variants exist for all
the functions that take a path as a variable number of arguments.

    int maapi_create(
    int sock, int thandle, const char *fmt, ...);

Create a new list entry, a `presence` container, or a leaf of type
`empty` (unless in a `union`, see the C_EMPTY section in
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types)) in the data tree. For example:
`maapi_create(sock,th,"/servers/server{www}");`

If we are creating a new server entry as above, we must also populate
all other data nodes below, which do not have a default value in the
data model. Thus we must also do e.g.:

`maapi_set_elem2(sock, th, "80", "/servers/server{www}/port");`

before we try to commit the data.

    int maapi_get_object(
    int sock, int thandle, confd_value_t *values, int n, const char *fmt, 
    ...);

This function reads at most `n` values from the list entry or container
specified by the path, and places them in the `values` array, which is
provided by the caller. The array is populated according to the
specification of the Value Array format in the [XML
STRUCTURES](section3.md#confd_types.xml_structures) section of the
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) manual page.

On success, the function returns the actual number of elements needed.
I.e. if the return value is bigger than `n`, only the values for the
first `n` elements are in the array, and the remaining values have been
discarded. Note that given the specification of the array contents,
there is always a fixed upper bound on the number of actual elements,
and if there are no `presence` sub-containers, the number is constant.
See the description of `cdb_get_object()` in
[confd_lib_cdb(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_cdb) for usage examples - they apply
to `maapi_get_object()` as well.

    int maapi_get_objects(
    struct maapi_cursor *mc, confd_value_t *values, int n, int *nobj);

Similar to `maapi_get_object()`, but reads multiple list entries based
on a `struct maapi_cursor`. At most `n` values from each of at most
`*nobj` list entries, starting at the entry after the one given by
`*mc`, are read and placed in the `values` array. The cursor must have
been initialized with `maapi_init_cursor()` at some point before the
call, but in principle it is possible to mix calls to `maapi_get_next()`
and `maapi_get_objects()` using the same cursor.

The array must be at least `n * *nobj` elements long, and the values for
entry `i` start at element `array[i * n]` (i.e. the first entry read
starts at `array[0]`, the second at `array[n]`, and so on). On success,
the highest actual number of values in any of the entries read is
returned. If we attempt to read more entries than actually exist (i.e.
if there are less than `*nobj` entries after the entry indicated by
`*mc`), `*nobj` is updated with the actual number (possibly 0) of
entries read. In this case the `n` element of the cursor is set to 0 as
for `maapi_get_next()`. Example - read the data for all entries in the
"server" list above, in chunks of 10:

<div class="informalexample">

    #define VALUES_PER_ENTRY 3
    #define ENTRIES_PER_REQUEST 10

    struct maapi_cursor mc;
    confd_value_t v[ENTRIES_PER_REQUEST*VALUES_PER_ENTRY];
    int nobj, ret, i;

    maapi_init_cursor(sock, th, &mc, "/servers/server");
    do {
        nobj = ENTRIES_PER_REQUEST;
        ret = maapi_get_objects(&mc, v, VALUES_PER_ENTRY, &nobj);
        if (ret >= 0) {
            for (i = 0; i < nobj; i++) {
                ... process entry starting at v[i*VALUES_PER_ENTRY] ...
            }
        } else {
            ... handle error ...
        }
    } while (ret >= 0 && mc.n != 0);
    maapi_destroy_cursor(&mc);

</div>

See also the description of `cdb_get_object()` in
[confd_lib_cdb(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_cdb) for examples on how to use

values in the value array.

    int maapi_get_values(
    int sock, int thandle, confd_tag_value_t *values, int n, const char *fmt, 
    ...);

Read an arbitrary set of sub-elements of a container or list entry. The
`values` array must be pre-populated with `n` values based on the
specification of the *Tagged Value Array* format in the *XML STRUCTURES*
section of the [confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) manual page, where
the `confd_value_t` value element is given as follows:

- C_NOEXISTS means that the value should be read from the transaction
  and stored in the array.

- C_PTR also means that the value should be read from the transaction,
  but instead gives the expected type and a pointer to the type-specific
  variable where the value should be stored. Thus this gives a
  functionality similar to the type safe `maapi_get_xxx_elem()`
  functions.

- C_XMLBEGIN and C_XMLEND are used as per the specification.

- Keys to select list entries can be given with their values.

> **Note**  
>  
> When we use C_PTR, we need to take special care to free any allocated
> memory. When we use C_NOEXISTS and the value is stored in the array,

All elements have the same position in the array after the call, in
order to simplify extraction of the values - this means that optional
elements that were requested but didn't exist will have C_NOEXISTS
rather than being omitted from the array. However requesting a list
entry that doesn't exist is an error. Note that when using C_PTR, the
only indication of a non-existing value is that the destination variable
has not been modified - it's up to the application to set it to some
"impossible" value before the call when optional leafs are read.

    int maapi_set_object(
    int sock, int thandle, const confd_value_t *values, int n, const char *fmt, 
    ...);

Set all leafs corresponding to the complete contents of a list entry or
container, excluding for sub-lists. The `values` array must be populated
with `n` values according to the specification of the Value Array format
in the [XML STRUCTURES](section3.md#confd_types.xml_structures) section of
the [confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) manual page. Additionally,
since operational data cannot be written, array elements corresponding
to operational data leafs or containers must have the value C_NOEXISTS.

If the node specified by the path, or any sub-nodes that are specified
as existing, do not exist before this call, they will be created,
otherwise the existing values will be updated. Nodes that can be deleted
and are specified as not existing in the array, i.e. with value
C_NOEXISTS, will be deleted if they existed before the call.

For a list entry, since the key values must be present in the array, it
is not required that the key values are included in the path given by
`fmt`. If the key values *are* included in the path, the key values in
the array are ignored.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,

    int maapi_set_values(
    int sock, int thandle, const confd_tag_value_t *values, int n, const char *fmt, 
    ...);

Set arbitrary sub-elements of a container or list entry. The `values`
array must be populated with `n` values according to the specification
of the *Tagged Value Array* format in the *XML STRUCTURES* section of
the [confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) manual page.

If the container or list entry itself, or any sub-elements that are
specified as existing, do not exist before this call, they will be
created, otherwise the existing values will be updated. Both mandatory
and optional elements may be omitted from the array, and all omitted
elements are left unchanged. To actually delete a non-mandatory leaf or
presence container as described for `maapi_set_object()`, it may (as an
extension of the format) be specified as C_NOEXISTS instead of being
omitted.

For a list entry, the key values can be specified either in the path or
via key elements in the array - if the values are in the path, the key
elements can be omitted from the array. For sub-lists present in the
array, the key elements must of course always also be present though,
immediately following the C_XMLBEGIN element and in the order defined by
the data model. It is also possible to delete a list entry by using a
C_XMLBEGINDEL element, followed by the keys in data model order,
followed by a C_XMLEND element.

    int maapi_get_case(
    int sock, int thandle, const char *choice, confd_value_t *rcase, const char *fmt, 
    ...);

When we use the YANG `choice` statement in the data model, this function
can be used to find the currently selected `case`, avoiding useless
`maapi_get_elem()` etc requests for nodes that belong to other cases.
The `fmt, ...` arguments give the path to the list entry or container
where the choice is defined, and `choice` is the name of the choice. The
case value is returned to the `confd_value_t` that `rcase` points to, as
type C_XMLTAG - i.e. we can use the `CONFD_GET_XMLTAG()` macro to
retrieve the hashed tag value.

If we have "nested" choices, i.e. multiple levels of `choice` statements
without intervening `container` or `list` statements in the data model,
the `choice` argument must give a '/'-separated path with alternating
choice and case names, from the data node given by the `fmt, ...`
arguments to the specific choice that the request pertains to.

For a choice without a `mandatory true` statement where no case is
currently selected, the function will fail with CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS if
the choice doesn't have a default case. If it has a default case, it
will be returned unless the MAAPI_FLAG_NO_DEFAULTS flag is in effect
(see `maapi_set_flags()` below) - if the flag is set, the value returned
via `rcase` will have type C_DEFAULT.

    int sock, int thandle, uint32_t *attrs, int num_attrs, confd_attr_value_t **attr_vals, 
    int *num_vals, const char *fmt, ...);

Retrieve attributes for a configuration node. These attributes are
currently supported:

<div class="informalexample">

    /* CONFD_ATTR_TAGS: value is C_LIST of C_BUF/C_STR */
    #define CONFD_ATTR_TAGS       0x80000000

    /* CONFD_ATTR_REFCOUNT: value is C_UINT32 */
    #define CONFD_ATTR_REFCOUNT 0x80000002

</div>

The `attrs` parameter is an array of attributes of length `num_attrs`,
specifying the wanted attributes - if `num_attrs` is 0, all attributes
are retrieved. If no attributes are found, `*num_vals` is set to 0,
otherwise an array of `confd_attr_value_t` elements is allocated and
populated, its address stored in `*attr_vals`, and `*num_vals` is set to
the number of elements in the array. The `confd_attr_value_t` struct is
defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
typedef struct confd_attr_value {
    uint32_t attr;
    confd_value_t v;
} confd_attr_value_t;
```

</div>

If any attribute values are returned (`*num_vals` \> 0), the caller must
free the allocated memory by calling `confd_free_value()` for each of
the `confd_value_t` elements, and `free(3)` for the `*attr_vals` array
itself.

    int maapi_delete_all(
    int sock, int thandle, enum maapi_delete_how how);

This function can be used to delete "all" the configuration data within
a transaction. The `how` argument specifies the extent of "all":

`MAAPI_DEL_SAFE`  
> Delete everything except namespaces that were exported to none (with
> `tailf:export none`). Toplevel nodes that cannot be deleted due to AAA
> rules are silently left in place, but descendant nodes will still be

    int maapi_set_flags(
    int sock, int thandle, int flags);

We can modify some aspects of the read/write session by calling this
function - these values can be used for the `flags` argument (ORed
together if more than one) with this function and/or with
`maapi_start_trans_flags()`:

<div class="informalexample">

    #define MAAPI_FLAG_HINT_BULK           (1 << 0)
    #define MAAPI_FLAG_NO_DEFAULTS         (1 << 1)
    #define MAAPI_FLAG_CONFIG_ONLY         (1 << 2)

    /* maapi_start_trans_flags() only */
    #define MAAPI_FLAG_HIDE_ALL_HIDEGROUPS (1 << 8)

</div>

MAAPI_FLAG_HINT_BULK tells the ConfD backplane that we will be reading
substantial amounts of data. This has the effect that the `get_object()`
and `get_next_object()` callbacks (if available) are used towards
external data providers when we call `maapi_get_elem()` etc and
`maapi_get_next()`. The `maapi_get_object()` function always operates as
if this flag was set.

MAAPI_FLAG_NO_DEFAULTS says that we want to be informed when we read
leafs with default values that have not had a value set. This is
indicated by the returned value being of type C_DEFAULT instead of the
actual value. The default value for such leafs can be obtained from the
`confd_cs_node` tree provided by the library (see
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types)).

MAAPI_FLAG_CONFIG_ONLY will make the maapi_get_xxx() functions return
config nodes only - if we attempt to read operational data, it will be
treated as if the nodes did not exist. This is mainly useful in
conjunction with `maapi_get_object()` and list entries or containers
that have both config and operational data (the operational data nodes
in the returned array will have the "value" C_NOEXISTS), but the other
functions also obey the flag.

MAAPI_FLAG_HIDE_INACTIVE can only be used with
`maapi_start_trans_flags()`, and only when starting a readonly
transaction (parameter `readwrite` == `CONFD_READ`). It will hide
configuration data that has the `CONFD_ATTR_INACTIVE` attribute set,
i.e. it will appear as if that data does not exist.

MAAPI_FLAG_DELAYED_WHEN can also only be used with
`maapi_start_trans_flags()`, but regardless of whether the flag is used
or not, the "delayed when" mode can subsequently be changed with
`maapi_set_delayed_when()`. The flag is only meaningful when starting a
read-write transaction (parameter `readwrite` == `CONFD_READ_WRITE`),
and will cause "delayed when" mode to be enabled from the beginning of
the transaction. See the description of `maapi_set_delayed_when()` for
information about the "delayed when" mode.

MAAPI_FLAG_HIDE_ALL_HIDEGROUPS can only be used with
`maapi_start_trans_flags()`. It will hide all nodes with `tailf:hidden`
statement.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_set_delayed_when(
    int sock, int thandle, int on);

This function enables (`on` non-zero) or disables (`on` == 0) the
"delayed when" mode of a transaction. When successful, it returns 1 or 0
as indication of whether "delayed when" was enabled or disabled before
the call. See also the `MAAPI_FLAG_DELAYED_WHEN` flag for
`maapi_start_trans_flags()`.

The YANG `when` statement makes its parent data definition statement
conditional. This can be problematic in cases where we don't have
control over the order of writing different data nodes. E.g. when
loading configuration from a file, the data that will satisfy the `when`
condition may occur after the data that the `when` applies to, making it
impossible to actually write the latter data into the transaction -
since the `when` isn't satisfied, the data nodes effectively do not
exist in the schema.

This is addressed by the "delayed when" mode for a transaction. When
"delayed when" is enabled, it is possible to write to data nodes even
though they are conditional on a `when` that isn't satisfied. It has no
effect on reading though - trying to read data that is conditional on an
unsatisfied `when` will always result in CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS or
equivalent. When disabling "delayed when", any "delayed" `when`
statements will take effect immediately - i.e. if the `when` isn't
satisfied at that point, the conditional nodes and any data values for
them will be deleted. If we don't explicitly disable "delayed when" by
calling this function, it will be automatically disabled when the
transaction enters the VALIDATE state (e.g. due to call of
`maapi_apply_trans()`).

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_set_label(
    int sock, int thandle, const char *label);

Set the "Label" that is stored in the rollback file when a transaction
towards running is committed. Setting the "Label" for transactions via
candidate can be done when the candidate is committed to running, by
using the `maapi_candidate_commit_info()` function. For a confirmed
commit, the "Label" must also be given via the
`maapi_candidate_confirmed_commit_info()` function.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_set_comment(
    int sock, int thandle, const char *comment);

Set the "Comment" that is stored in the rollback file when a transaction
towards running is committed. Setting the "Comment" for transactions via
candidate can be done when the candidate is committed to running, by
using the `maapi_candidate_commit_info()` function. For a confirmed
commit, the "Comment" must also be given via the
`maapi_candidate_confirmed_commit_info()` function.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

### Ncs Specific Functions

The functions in this sections can only be used with NCS, and
specifically the maapi_shared_xxx() functions must be used for NCS
FASTMAP, i.e. in the service `create()` callback. Those functions
maintain attributes that are necessary when multiple service instances
modify the same data.

    int maapi_shared_create(
    int sock, int thandle, int flags, const char *fmt, ...);

FASTMAP version of `maapi_create()`. The `flags` parameter must be given
as 0.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_BADPATH, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS, CONFD_ERR_BADTYPE,
CONFD_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED, CONFD_ERR_NOT_WRITABLE, CONFD_ERR_NOTCREATABLE,
CONFD_ERR_INUSE

    int maapi_shared_set_elem(

    int maapi_shared_set_elem2(
    int sock, int thandle, const char *strval, int flags, const char *fmt, 
    ...);

FASTMAP versions of `maapi_set_elem()` and `maapi_set_elem2()`. The
`flags` parameter is currently unused and should be given as 0.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_BADPATH, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS, CONFD_ERR_BADTYPE,
CONFD_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED, CONFD_ERR_NOT_WRITABLE, CONFD_ERR_INUSE

    int maapi_shared_insert(
    int sock, int thandle, int flags, const char *fmt, ...);

FASTMAP version of `maapi_insert()`. The `flags` parameter must be given
as 0.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED, CONFD_ERR_BADTYPE, CONFD_ERR_NOT_WRITABLE,
CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS, CONFD_ERR_NOTDELETABLE

    int maapi_shared_set_values(
    int sock, int thandle, const confd_tag_value_t *values, int n, int flags, 
    const char *fmt, ...);

FASTMAP version of `maapi_set_values()`. The `flags` parameter must be
given as 0.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_BADPATH, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS, CONFD_ERR_BADTYPE,
CONFD_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED, CONFD_ERR_NOT_WRITABLE, CONFD_ERR_INUSE

    int maapi_shared_copy_tree(
    int sock, int thandle, int flags, const char *from, const char *tofmt, 
    ...);

FASTMAP version of `maapi_copy_tree()`. The `flags` parameter must be
given as 0.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED, CONFD_ERR_NOT_WRITABLE, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH

    int maapi_ncs_apply_template(
    int sock, int thandle, char *template_name, const struct ncs_name_value *variables, 
    int num_variables, int flags, const char *rootfmt, ...);

Apply a template that has been loaded into NCS. The `template_name`
parameter gives the name of the template. The `variables` parameter is
an `num_variables` long array of variables and names for substitution
into the template. The `struct ncs_name_value` is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct ncs_name_value {
    char *name;
    char *value;
};
```

</div>

The `flags` parameter is currently unused and should be given as 0.

CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS, CONFD_ERR_XPATH

    int maapi_shared_ncs_apply_template(
    int sock, int thandle, char *template_name, const struct ncs_name_value *variables, 
    int num_variables, int flags, const char *rootfmt, ...);

FASTMAP version of `maapi_ncs_apply_template()`. Normally the `flags`
parameter should be given as 0.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED, CONFD_ERR_NOT_WRITABLE, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH,
CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS, CONFD_ERR_XPATH

    int maapi_ncs_get_templates(
    int sock, char ***templates, int *num_templates);

Retrieve a list of the templates currently loaded into NCS. On success,
a pointer to an array of template names is stored in `templates` and the
length of the array is stored in `num_templates`. The library allocates
memory for the result, and the caller is responsible for freeing it.
This can in all cases be done with code like this:

<div class="informalexample">

    char **templates;
    int num_templates, i;

    if (maapi_ncs_get_templates(sock, &templates, &num_templates) == CONFD_OK) {
        ...
        for (i = 0; i < num_templates; i++) {
            free(templates[i]);
        }
        if (num_templates > 0) {
            free(templates);
        }
    }

</div>

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

    int maapi_cs_node_children(
    int sock, int thandle, struct confd_cs_node *mount_point, struct confd_cs_node ***children, 
    int *num_children, const char *fmt, ...);

Retrieve a list of the children nodes of the node given by `mount_point`
that are valid for the path given by `fmt`. The `mount_point` node must
be a mount point (i.e. have the flag `CS_NODE_HAS_MOUNT_POINT` set), and
the path must lead to a specific instance of this node (including the
final keys if `mount_point` is a list node). The `thandle` parameter is
optional, i.e. it can be given as `-1` if a transaction is not
available.

On success, a pointer to an array of pointers to `struct confd_cs_node`
is stored in `children` and the length of the array is stored in
`num_children`. The library allocates memory for the array, and the
caller is responsible for freeing it by means of a call to `free(3)`.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_BADPATH

    struct confd_cs_node *maapi_cs_node_cd(
    int sock, int thandle, const char *fmt, ...);

Does the same thing as `confd_cs_node_cd()` (see
[confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib)), but can handle paths that are
ambiguous due to traversing a mount point, by sending a request to the
NSO daemon. To be used when `confd_cs_node_cd()` returns `NULL` with
`confd_errno` set to `CONFD_ERR_NO_MOUNT_ID`.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_BADPATH

### Miscellaneous Functions

    int maapi_delete_config(
    int sock, enum confd_dbname name);

This function empties a data store.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL

    int maapi_copy(
    int sock, int from_thandle, int to_thandle);

If we open two transactions from the same user session but towards
different data stores, such as one transaction towards startup and one
towards running, we can copy all data from one data store to the other
with this function. This is a replace operation - any configuration that
exists in the transaction given by `to_handle` but not in the one given
by `from_handle` will be deleted from the `to_handle` transaction.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED, CONFD_ERR_NOT_WRITABLE

    int maapi_copy_path(
    int sock, int from_thandle, int to_thandle, const char *fmt, ...);

Similar to `maapi_copy()`, but does a replacing copy only of the subtree
rooted at the path given by `fmt` and remaining arguments.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED, CONFD_ERR_NOT_WRITABLE

    int maapi_copy_tree(
    int sock, int thandle, const char *from, const char *tofmt, ...);

This function copies the entire configuration tree rooted at `from` to
`tofmt`. List entries are created accordingly. If the destination
already exists, `from` is copied on top of the destination. This
function is typically used inside actions where we for example could use
`maapi_copy_tree()` to copy a template configuration into a new list
entry. The `from` path must be pre-formatted, e.g. using
`confd_format_keypath()`, whereas the destination path is formatted by
this function.

> **Note**  
>  
> The data models for the source and destination trees must match - i.e.
> they must either be identical, or the data model for the source tree

CONFD_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED, CONFD_ERR_NOT_WRITABLE, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH

    int maapi_insert(
    int sock, int thandle, const char *fmt, ...);

This function inserts a new entry in a list that uses the
`tailf:indexed-view` statement. The key must be of type integer. If the
inserted entry already exists, the existing and subsequent entries will
be renumbered as needed, unless renumbering would require an entry to
have a key value that is outside the range of the type for the key. In
that case, the function returns CONFD_ERR with `confd_errno` set to
CONFD_ERR_BADTYPE.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED, CONFD_ERR_BADTYPE, CONFD_ERR_NOT_WRITABLE,
CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS, CONFD_ERR_NOTDELETABLE

    int maapi_move(
    int sock, int thandle, confd_value_t* tokey, int n, const char *fmt, ...);

This function moves an existing list entry, i.e. renames the entry using
the `tokey` parameter, which is an array containing `n` keys.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,
CONFD_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED, CONFD_ERR_NOT_WRITABLE, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS,
CONFD_ERR_NOTMOVABLE, CONFD_ERR_ALREADY_EXISTS

    int maapi_move_ordered(
    int sock, int thandle, enum maapi_move_where where, confd_value_t* tokey, 
    int n, const char *fmt, ...);

For a list with the YANG `ordered-by user` statement, this function can
be used to change the order of entries, by moving one entry to a new
position. When new entries in such a list are created with
`maapi_create()`, they are always placed last in the list. The path
given by `fmt` and the remaining arguments identifies the entry to move,
and the new position is given by the `where` argument:

MAAPI_MOVE_FIRST  
> Move the entry first in the list. The `tokey` and `n` arguments are
> ignored, and can be given as NULL and 0.

MAAPI_MOVE_LAST  
> Move the entry last in the list. The `tokey` and `n` arguments are
> ignored, and can be given as NULL and 0.

MAAPI_MOVE_BEFORE  
> Move the entry to the position before the entry given by the `tokey`
> argument, which is an array of key values with length `n`.

MAAPI_MOVE_AFTER  
> Move the entry to the position after the entry given by the `tokey`
> argument, which is an array of key values with length `n`.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,

CONFD_ERR_NOTMOVABLE

    int maapi_authenticate(
    int sock, const char *user, const char *pass, char *groups[], int n);

If we are implementing a proprietary management agent with MAAPI API,
the function `maapi_start_user_session()` requires the application to
tell ConfD which groups the user are member of. ConfD itself has the
capability to authenticate users. A MAAPI application can use
`maapi_authenticate()` to let ConfD authenticate the user, as per the
AAA configuration in confd.conf

If the authentication is successful, the function returns `1`, and the
`groups[]` array is populated with at most `n-1` NUL-terminated strings
containing the group names, followed by a NULL pointer that indicates
the end of the group list. The strings are dynamically allocated, and it
is up to the caller to free the memory by calling `free(3)` for each
string. If the function is used in a context where the group names are
not needed, pass `1` for the `n` parameter.

If the authentication fails, the function returns `0`, and
`confd_lasterr()` (see [confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib)) will
return a message describing the reason for the failure.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION

    int maapi_authenticate2(
    int sock, const char *user, const char *pass, const struct confd_ip *src_addr, 
    int src_port, const char *context, enum confd_proto prot, char *groups[], 
    int n);

This function does the same thing as `maapi_authenticate()`, but allows
for passing of the additional parameters `src_addr`, `src_port`,
`context`, and `prot`, which otherwise are passed only to
`maapi_start_user_session()`/`maapi_start_user_session2()`. These
parameters are not used when ConfD performs the authentication, but they
will be passed to an external authentication executable (see the if
/confdConfig/aaa/externalAuthentication/includeExtra is set to "true" in
`confd.conf`, see [confd.conf(5)](section5.md#ncs.conf). They will also be
made available to the authentication callback that can be registered by
an application (see
[confd_lib_dp(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_dp.authentication_callback)).

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_PROTOUSAGE, CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS,
CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION

    int maapi_attach(
    int sock, int hashed_ns, struct confd_trans_ctx *ctx);

While ConfD is executing a transaction, we have a number of situations
where we wish to invoke user C code which can interact in the
transaction. One such situation is when we wish to write semantic
validation code which is invoked in the validation phase of a ConfD
transaction. This code needs to execute within the context of the
executing transaction, it must thus have access to the "shadow" storage
where all not-yet-committed data is kept.

This function attaches to a existing transaction.

Another situation where we wish to attach to the executing transaction
is when we are using the notifications API and subscribe to notification
of type CONFD_NOTIF_COMMIT_DIFF and wish to read the committed diffs
from the transaction.

The `hashed_ns` parameter is basically just there to save a call to
`maapi_set_namespace()`. We can call `maapi_set_namespace()` any number
of times to change from the one we passed to `maapi_attach()`, and we
can also give the namespace in prefix form in the path parameter to the
read/write functions - see the `maapi_set_namespace()` description.

If we do not want to give a specific namespace when invoking
`maapi_attach()`, we can give 0 for the `hashed_ns` parameter (-1 works
too but is deprecated). We can still call the read/write functions as
long as the toplevel element in the path is unique, but otherwise we
must call `maapi_set_namespace()`, or use a prefix in the path.

    int maapi_attach2(
    int sock, int hashed_ns, int usid, int thandle);

When we write proprietary CLI commands in C and we wish those CLI
commands to be able to use MAAPI to read and write data inside the same
transaction the CLI command was invoked in, we do not have an
initialized transaction structure available. Then we must use this
function. CLI commands get the `usid` passed in UNIX environment
variable `CONFD_MAAPI_USID` and the `thandle` passed in environment
variable `CONFD_MAAPI_THANDLE`. We also need to use this function when
implementing such CLI commands via action `command()` callbacks, see the
[confd_lib_dp(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_dp) man page. In this case the `usid`
is provided via `uinfo->usid` and the `thandle` via
`uinfo->actx.thandle`. To use the user session id that is the owner of
the transaction, set `usid` to 0. If the namespace does not matter set
`hashed_ns` to 0, see `maapi_attach()`.

    int maapi_attach_init(
    int sock, int *thandle);

This function is used to attach the MAAPI socket to the special
transaction available in phase0 used for CDB initialization and upgrade.
The function is also used if we need to modify CDB data during
in-service data model upgrade. The transaction handle, which is used in
subsequent calls to MAAPI, is filled in by the function upon successful
return. See the CDB chapter in the Development Guide.

    int maapi_detach(
    int sock, struct confd_trans_ctx *ctx);

Detaches an attached MAAPI socket. This function is typically called in
the `stop()` callback in validation code. An attached MAAPI socket will
be automatically detached when the ConfD transaction terminates. This
function performs an explicit detach.

    int maapi_detach2(
    int sock, int thandle);

Detaches an attached MAAPI socket when we do not have an initialized
transaction structure available, see `maapi_attach2()` above. This is
mainly useful in an action `command()` callback.

    int maapi_diff_iterate(
    int sock, int thandle, enum maapi_iter_ret (*iter
          kp, enum maapi_iter_op op, 
    confd_value_t *oldv, confd_value_t *newv, void *state, int flags, void *initstate);

This function can be called from an attached MAAPI session. The purpose
of the function is to iterate through the transaction diff. It can
typically be used in conjunction with the notification API when we
subscribe to CONFD_NOTIF_COMMIT_DIFF events. It can also be used inside
validation callbacks.

For all diffs in the transaction the supplied callback function `iter()`
will be called. The `iter()` callback receives the `confd_hkeypath_t kp`
which uniquely identifies which node in the data tree that is affected,
the operation, and an optional value. The `op` parameter gives the
modification as:

MOP_CREATED  
> The list entry, `presence` container, or leaf of type `empty` (unless
> in a `union`, see the C_EMPTY section in
> [confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types)) given by `kp` has been created.

MOP_DELETED  
> The list entry, `presence` container, or optional leaf given by `kp`
> has been deleted.

MOP_MODIFIED  
> A descendant of the list entry given by `kp` has been modified.

MOP_VALUE_SET  
> The value of the leaf given by `kp` has been set to `newv`. If the
> MAAPI_FLAG_NO_DEFAULTS flag has been set and the default value for the
> leaf has come into effect, `newv` will be of type C_DEFAULT instead of
> giving the default value.

MOP_MOVED_AFTER  
> The list entry given by `kp`, in an `ordered-by user` list, has been
> moved. If `newv` is NULL, the entry has been moved first in the list,
> otherwise it has been moved after the entry given by `newv`. In this
> case `newv` is a pointer to an array of key values identifying an
> entry in the list. The array is terminated with an element that has
> type C_NOEXISTS.
>
> If a list entry has been created and moved at the same time, the
> callback is first called with MOP_CREATED and then with
> MOP_MOVED_AFTER.
>
> If a list entry has been modified and moved at the same time, the
> callback is first called with MOP_MODIFIED and then with
> MOP_MOVED_AFTER.

MOP_ATTR_SET  
> An attribute for the node given by `kp` has been modified (see the
> description of `maapi_get_attrs()` for the supported attributes). The
> `iter()` callback will only get this invocation when attributes are
> enabled in `confd.conf` (/confdConfig/enableAttributes, see
> [confd.conf(5)](section5.md#ncs.conf)) *and* the flag `ITER_WANT_ATTR` has
> been passed to `maapi_diff_iterate()`. The `newv` parameter is a
> pointer to a 2-element array, where the first element is the attribute
> represented as a `confd_value_t` of type `C_UINT32` and the second
> element is the value the attribute was set to. If the attribute has
> been deleted, the second element is of type `C_NOEXISTS`.

The `oldv` parameter passed to `iter()` is always NULL.

If `iter()` returns ITER_STOP, no more iteration is done, and CONFD_OK
is returned. If `iter()` returns ITER_RECURSE iteration continues with
all children to the node. If `iter()` returns ITER_CONTINUE iteration
ignores the children to the node (if any), and continues with the node's
sibling. If, for some reason, the `iter()` function wants to return
control to the caller of `maapi_diff_iterate()` *before* all the changes
have been iterated over it can return ITER_SUSPEND. The caller then has
to call `maapi_diff_iterate_resume()` to continue/finish the iteration.

The `flags` parameter is a bitmask with the following bits:

ITER_WANT_ATTR  
> Enable `MOP_ATTR_SET` invocations of the `iter()` function.

ITER_WANT_P_CONTAINER  
> Invoke `iter()` for modified presence-containers.

The `state` parameter can be used for any user supplied state (i.e.
whatever is supplied as `init_state` is passed as `state` to `iter()` in
each invocation).

The `iter()` invocations are not subjected to AAA checks, i.e.
regardless of which path we have and which context was used to create
the MAAPI socket, all changes are provided.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS,
CONFD_ERR_BADSTATE.

CONFD_ERR_BADSTATE is returned when we try to iterate on a transaction
which is in the wrong state and not attached.

    int maapi_keypath_diff_iterate(
    int sock, int thandle, enum maapi_iter_ret (*iter
          kp, enum maapi_iter_op op, 
    confd_value_t *oldv, confd_value_t *newv, void *state, int flags, void *initstate, 
    const char *fmtpath, ...);

This function behaves precisely like the `maapi_diff_iterate()` function
except that it takes an additional format path argument. This path
prunes the diff and only changes below the provided path are considered.

    int maapi_diff_iterate_resume(
    int sock, enum maapi_iter_ret reply, enum maapi_iter_ret (*iter
          kp, 
    enum maapi_iter_op op, confd_value_t *oldv, confd_value_t *newv, void *state, 
    void *resumestate);

The application *must* call this function to finish up the iteration
whenever an iterator function for `maapi_diff_iterate()` or
`maapi_keypath_diff_iterate()` has returned ITER_SUSPEND. If the
application does not wish to continue iteration, it must at least call
`maapi_diff_iterate_resume(s, ITER_STOP, NULL, NULL);` to clean up the
state. The `reply` parameter is what the iterator function would have
returned (i.e. normally ITER_RECURSE or ITER_CONTINUE) if it hadn't
returned ITER_SUSPEND. Note that it is up to the iterator function to
somehow communicate that it has returned ITER_SUSPEND to the caller of
`maapi_diff_iterate()` or `maapi_keypath_diff_iterate()`, this can for
example be a field in a struct for which a pointer can be passed back
and forth via the `state`/`resumestate` parameters.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS,
CONFD_ERR_BADSTATE.

    int maapi_iterate(
    int sock, int thandle, enum maapi_iter_ret (*iter
          kp, confd_value_t *v, 
    confd_attr_value_t *attr_vals, int num_attr_vals, void *state, int flags, 
    void *initstate, const char *fmtpath, ...);

This function can be used to iterate over all the data in a transaction
and the underlying data store, as opposed to iterating over only the
changes like `maapi_diff_iterate()` and `maapi_keypath_diff_iterate()`
do. The `fmtpath` parameter can be used to prune the iteration to cover
only the subtree below the given path, similar to
`maapi_keypath_diff_iterate()` - if `fmtpath` is given as `"/"`, there
will not be any such pruning. Additionally, if the flag
`MAAPI_FLAG_CONFIG_ONLY` is in effect (see `maapi_set_flags()`), all
operational data subtrees will be excluded from the iteration.

The supplied callback function `iter()` will be called for each node in
the data tree included in the iteration. It receives the `kp` parameter
which uniquely identifies the node, and if the node is a leaf with a
type, also the value of the leaf as the `v` parameter - otherwise `v` is
NULL.

The `flags` parameter is a bitmask with the following bits:

ITER_WANT_ATTR  
> If this flag is given and the node has any attributes set, the
> `attr_vals` parameter will point to a `num_attr_vals` long array of
> attributes and values (see `maapi_get_attrs()`), otherwise `attr_vals`
> is NULL.

The return value from `iter()` has the same effect as for
`maapi_diff_iterate()`, except that if ITER_SUSPEND is returned, the
caller then has to call `maapi_iterate_resume()` to continue/finish the
iteration.

    int maapi_iterate_resume(
    int sock, enum maapi_iter_ret reply, enum maapi_iter_ret (*iter
          kp, 
    confd_value_t *v, confd_attr_value_t *attr_vals, int num_attr_vals, void *state, 
    void *resumestate);

The application *must* call this function to finish up the iteration
whenever an iterator function for `maapi_iterate()` has returned
ITER_SUSPEND. If the application does not wish to continue iteration, it
must at least call `maapi_iterate_resume(s, ITER_STOP, NULL, NULL);` to
clean up the state. The `reply` parameter is what the iterator function
would have returned (i.e. normally ITER_RECURSE or ITER_CONTINUE) if it
hadn't returned ITER_SUSPEND. Note that it is up to the iterator
function to somehow communicate that it has returned ITER_SUSPEND to the
caller of `maapi_iterate()`, this can for example be a field in a struct
for which a pointer can be passed back and forth via the
`state`/`resumestate` parameters.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS,
CONFD_ERR_BADSTATE.

    int maapi_get_running_db_status(
    int sock);

If a transaction fails in the commit() phase, the configuration database
is in in a possibly inconsistent state. This function queries ConfD on
the consistency state. Returns 1 if the configuration is consistent and
0 otherwise.

    int maapi_set_running_db_status(
    int sock, int status);

This function explicitly sets ConfDs notion of the consistency state.

    int maapi_list_rollbacks(
    int sock, struct maapi_rollback *rp, int *rp_size);

List at most `*rp_size` number of rollback files. The number of existing
rollback files is reported in \*rp_size as well. The function will
populate an array of maapi_rollback structs.

    int maapi_load_rollback(
    int sock, int thandle, int rollback_num);

Install a rollback file.

    int maapi_load_rollback_fixed(
    int sock, int thandle, int fixed_num);

Install a rollback file using fixed numbering.

    int maapi_request_action(
    int sock, confd_tag_value_t *params, int nparams, confd_tag_value_t **values, 
    int *nvalues, int hashed_ns, const char *fmt, ...);

Invoke an action defined in the data model. The `params` and `values`
arrays are the parameters for and results from the action, respectively,
and use the Tagged Value Array format described in the [XML
STRUCTURES](section3.md#confd_types.xml_structures) section of the
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types) manual page. The library allocates
memory for the result values, and the caller is responsible for freeing
it. This can in all cases be done with code like this:

<div class="informalexample">

    confd_tag_value_t *values;
    int nvalues = 0, i;

    if (maapi_request_action(sock, params, nparams,
                             &values, &nvalues, myprefix__ns,
                             "/path/to/action") == CONFD_OK) {
        ...
        for (i = 0; i < nvalues; i++)
            confd_free_value(CONFD_GET_TAG_VALUE(&values[i]));
        if (nvalues > 0)
            free(values);
    }

</div>

However if the value array is known not to include types that require
memory allocation (see `maapi_get_elem()` above), only the array itself
needs to be freed.

The socket must have an established user session. The path given by
`fmt` and the varargs list is the full path to the action, i.e. the
final element must be the name of the action in the data model. Since
actions are not associated with ConfD transactions, the namespace must
be provided and the path must be absolute - but see
`maapi_request_action_th()` below.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION,

    int maapi_request_action_th(
    int sock, int thandle, confd_tag_value_t *params, int nparams, confd_tag_value_t **values, 
    int *nvalues, const char *fmt, ...);

Does the same thing as `maapi_request_action()`, but uses the current
namespace, the path position, and the user session from the transaction
indicated by `thandle`, and makes the transaction handle available to
the action() callback, see [confd_lib_dp(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_dp) (this
is the only relation to the transaction, and the transaction is not
affected in any way by the call itself). This function may be convenient
in some cases where actions are invoked in conjunction with a
transaction, and it must be used if the action needs to access the
transaction store.

    int maapi_request_action_str_th(
    int sock, int thandle, char **output, const char *cmd_fmt, const char *path_fmt, 
    ...);

Does the same thing as `maapi_request_action_th()`, but takes the
parameters as a string and returns the result as a string. The library
allocates memory for the result string, and the caller is responsible
for freeing it. This can in all cases be done with code like this:

<div class="informalexample">

    char *output = NULL;

    if (maapi_request_action_str_th(sock, th, &output,
        "test reverse listint [ 1 2 3 4 ]", "/path/to/action") == CONFD_OK) {
        ...
        free(output);
    }

</div>

The varargs in the end of the function must contain all values listed in
both format strings (that is `cmd_fmt` and `path_fmt`) in the same order
as they occur in the strings. Here follows an equivalent example which
uses the format strings:

<div class="informalexample">

    char *output = NULL;

    if (maapi_request_action_str_th(sock, th, &output,
        "test %s [ 1 2 3 %d ]", "%s/action",
        "reverse listint", 4, "/path/to") == CONFD_OK) {
        ...
        free(output);
    }

</div>

    int maapi_start_progress_span(

    const struct ncs_name_value *attrs, int num_attrs, const struct confd_progress_link *links, 
    int num_links, const char *path_fmt, ...);

Starts a progress span. Progress spans are trace messages written to the
progress trace and the developer log. A progress span consists of a
start and a stop event which can be used to calculate the duration
between the two. Those events can be identified with unique span-ids.
Inside the span it is possible to start new spans, which will then
become child spans, the parent-span-id is set to the previous spans'
span-id. A child span can be used to calculate the duration of a sub
task, and is started from consecutive `maapi_start_progress_span()`
calls, and is ended with `maapi_end_progress_span()`.

The concepts of traces, trace-id and spans are highly influenced by
https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/#spans

If the filters in a configured progress trace matches and the `verbose`
is the same as /progress/trace/verbosity or higher then a message `msg`
will be written to the trace. Other fields than the message can be set
by the following: `attributes` a key-value list of user defined
attributes. `links` is a list of already existing trace_id's and/or
span_id's. `path` is a keypath, e.g. of an action/leaf/service/etc.

If successful `result` when non-NULL are set to span_id and the trace_id
of the span.

While spans represents a pair of data points: start and stop; info
events are instead singular events, one point in time. Call
`maapi_progress_info()` to write a progress span info event to the
progress trace. The info event will have the same span-id as the start
and stop events of the currently ongoing progress span in the active
user session or transaction. See `maapi_start_progress_span()` for more
information.

Ends progress spans started from `maapi_start_progress_span()` or
`maapi_start_progress_span_th()`, a call to this function writes the
stop event to the progress trace. Ending a parent span implicitly ends
the child spans as well.

`annotation` when non-NULL writes a message on the stop event to the
progress trace.

If successful, the function returns the timestamp of the stop event.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOSESSION

    int maapi_xpath2kpath(
    int sock, const char *xpath, confd_hkeypath_t **hkp);

Convert a XPath path to a hashed keypath. The XPath expression must be
an "instance identifier", i.e. all elements and keys must be fully
specified. Namespace prefixes are optional, unless required to resolve
ambiguities (e.g. when multiple namespaces have the same root element).

The conversion will fail with CONFD_ERR_NO_MOUNT_ID if the provided
XPath traverses a mount point.

The returned keypath is dynamically allocated, and may further contain
dynamically allocated elements. The caller must free the allocated
memory, easiest done by calling `confd_free_hkeypath()`.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH,

mount points using the transaction indicated by `thandle` to read mount
point information.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH

    int maapi_user_message(
    int sock, const char *to, const char *message, const char *sender);

Send a message to a specific user, a specific user session or all users
depending on the `to` parameter. If set to a user name, then `message`
will be delivered to all CLI and Web UI sessions by that user. If set to
an integer string, eg "10", then `message` will be delivered to that
specific user session, CLI or Web UI. If set to "all" then all users
will get the `message`.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_sys_message(
    int sock, const char *to, const char *message);

Send a message to a specific user, a specific user session or all users
depending on the `to` parameter. If set to a user name, then `message`
will be delivered to all CLI and Web UI sessions by that user. If set to
an integer string, eg "10", then `message` will be delivered to that
specific user session, CLI or Web UI. If set to "all" then all users
will get the `message`. No formatting of the message is performed as
opposed to the user message where a timestamp and sender information is
added to the message.

System messages will be buffered until the ongoing command is finished
or is terminated by the user. In case of receiving too many system
messages during an ongoing command, the corresponding CLI process may
choke and slow down throughput which, in turn, causes memory to grow
over time. In order to prevent this from happening, buffered messages
are limited to 1000 and any incoming messages will be discarded once
this limit is exceeded.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_prio_message(
    int sock, const char *to, const char *message);

Send a high priority message to a specific user, a specific user session
or all users depending on the `to` parameter. If set to a user name,
then `message` will be delivered to all CLI and Web UI sessions by that
user. If set to an integer string, eg "10", then `message` will be
delivered to that specific user session, CLI or Web UI. If set to "all"
then all users will get the `message`. No formatting of the message is
performed as opposed to the user message where a timestamp and sender
information is added to the message.

The message will not be delayed until the user terminates any ongoing
command but will be output directly to the terminal without delay.
Messages sent using the maapi_sys_message and maapi_user_message, on the
other hand, are not displayed in the middle of some other output but
delayed until the any ongoing commands have terminated.

    int maapi_cli_prompt(
    int sock, int usess, const char *prompt, int echo, char *res, int size);

Prompt user for a string. The `echo` parameter is used to control if the
input should be echoed or not. If set to CONFD_ECHO all input will be
visible and if set to CONFD_NOECHO only stars will be shown instead of
the actual characters entered by the user. The resulting string will be
stored in `res` and it will be NUL terminated.

This function is intended to be called from inside an action callback
when invoked from the CLI.

non-negative `timeout` parameter, which controls how long (in seconds)
to wait for input before aborting.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_EOF,

    int maapi_cli_prompt_oneof(
    int sock, int usess, const char *prompt, char **choice, int count, char *res, 
    int size);

Prompt user for one of the strings given in the `choice` parameter. For
example:

<div class="informalexample">

    int res;
    char buf[BUFSIZ];
    char *choice[] = {"yes","no"};

    ...

    res = maapi_cli_prompt_oneof(sock, uinfo->usid,

                                 choice, 2, buf, BUFSIZ);

</div>

The user can enter a unique prefix of the choice but the value returned
in buf will always be one of the strings provided in the `choice`
parameter or an empty string if the user hits the enter key without
entering any value. The result string stored in buf is NUL terminated.
If the user enters a value not in `choice` he will automatically be
re-prompted. For example:

<div class="informalexample">

    Do you want to proceed (yes/no): maybe
    The value must be one of: yes,no.
    Do you want to proceed (yes/no):

Read a multi line string from the CLI. The user has to end the input
using ctrl-D. The entered characters will be stored NUL terminated in
res. The `echo` parameters controls if the entered characters should be
echoed or not. If set to CONFD_ECHO they will be visible and if set to
CONFD_NOECHO stars will be echoed instead.

This function is intended to be called from inside an action callback

    int sock, int thandle, char *res, int size, int flags, const char *fmt, 
    ...);

This function tries to determine which C-/I-style CLI command can be
associated with a given path in the data model in context of a given
transaction. This is determined by running the formatting code used by
the 'show running-config' command for the subtree given by the path, and
the looking for text lines associated with the given path.
Consequentcly, if the path does not exist in the transaction no output
will be generated, or if tailf:cli- annotations have been used to
suppress the 'show running-config' text for a path then no such command
can be derived.

The `flags` can be given as `MAAPI_FLAG_EMIT_PARENTS` to enable the
commands to reach the submode for the path to be emitted.

The `flags` can be given as `MAAPI_FLAG_DELETE` to emit the command to
delete the given path.

The `flags` can be given as `MAAPI_FLAG_NON_RECURSIVE` to prevent that
all children to a container or list item are displayed.

    int maapi_cli_cmd_to_path(
    int sock, const char *line, char *ns, int nsize, char *path, int psize);

Given a data model path formatted as a C- and I-style command, try to
determine the corresponding namespace and path. If the string cannot be
interpreted as a path an error message is given indicating that the
string is either an operational mode command, a configuration mode
command, or just badly formatted. The string is interpreted in the
context of the current running configuration, ie all xpath expressions
in the data model are evaluated in the context of the running config.
Note that the same input may result in a correct answer when invoked
with one state of the running config, and an error if the running config
has another state due to different list elements being present, or xpath
(when and display-when) expressions are being evaluated differently.

This function requires that the socket has an established user session.

The `line` is the NUL terminated string of command tokens to be
interpreted.

The `ns` and `path` parameters are used for storing the resulting
namespace and path.

The function returns `CONFD_ERR` on error or a positive integer id that
can subsequently be used together with `confd_stream_connect()`. ConfD
will write all data in a stream on that socket and when done, ConfD will
close its end of the socket.

Once the stream socket is connected we can read the output from the cli

    int maapi_set_readonly_mode(
    int sock, int flag);

There are certain situations where we want to explicitly control if a
ConfD instance should be able to handle write operations from the
northbound agents. In certain high-availability scenarios we may want to
ensure that a node is a true readonly node, i.e. it should not be
possible to initiate new write transactions on that node.

It can also be interesting in upgrade scenarios where we are interested
in making sure that no configuration changes can occur during some
interval.

This function toggles the readonly mode of a ConfD instance. If the
`flag` parameter is non-zero, ConfD will be set in readonly mode, if it
is zero, ConfD will be taken out of readonly mode. It is also worth to
note that when a ConfD HA node is a secondary as instructed by the
application, no write transactions can occur regardless of the value of
the flag set by this function.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS

    int maapi_disconnect_remote(
    int sock, const char *address);

Disconnect all remote connections between `CONFD_IPC_PORT` and
`address`.

Since ConfD clients, e.g. CDB readers/subscribers, are connected using
TCP it is also possible to do this remotely over a network. However
since TCP doesn't offer a fast and reliable way of detecting that the
other end has disappeared ConfD can get stuck waiting for a reply from
such a disconnected client.

In some environments there will be an alternative supervision method
that can detect when a remote host is unavailable, and in that situation
this function can be used to instruct ConfD to drop all remote
connections to a particular host. The address parameter is an IP address
as a string, and the socket is a maapi socket obtained using
`maapi_connect()`. On success, the function returns the number of
connections that were closed.

    int maapi_disconnect_sockets(
    int sock, int *sockets, int nsocks);

This function is an alternative to `maapi_disconnect_remote()` that can
be useful in particular when using the "External IPC" functionality. In
this case ConfD does not have any knowledge of the remote address of the
IPC connections, and thus `maapi_disconnect_remote()` is not applicable.
The `maapi_disconnect_sockets()` instead takes an array of `nsocks`
socket file descriptor numbers for the `sockets` parameter.

ConfD will close all connected sockets whose local file descriptor
number is included the `sockets` array. The file descriptor numbers can
be obtained e.g. via the `lsof(8)` command, or some similar tool in case
`lsof` does not support the IPC mechanism that is being used.

    int maapi_save_config(
    int sock, int thandle, int flags, const char *fmtpath, ...);

This function can be used to save the entire config (or a subset
thereof) in different formats. The `flags` parameter controls the saving
as follows. The value is a bitmask.

`MAAPI_CONFIG_XML`  
> The configuration format is XML.

`MAAPI_CONFIG_XML_PRETTY`  
> The configuration format is pretty printed XML.

`MAAPI_CONFIG_JSON`  
> The configuration is in JSON format.

`MAAPI_CONFIG_J`  
> The configuration is in curly bracket Juniper CLI format.

`MAAPI_CONFIG_C`

> The configuration is in Cisco XR style format. And a faster parser
> than the normal CLI will be used.

`MAAPI_CONFIG_C_IOS`  
> The configuration is in Cisco IOS style format.

`MAAPI_CONFIG_XPATH`  
> The `fmtpath` and remaining arguments give an XPath filter instead of

The provided path indicates which part(s) of the configuration to save.
By default it is interpreted as a keypath as for other MAAPI functions,
and thus identifies the root of a subtree to save. However it is
possible to indicate wildcarding of list keys by completely omitting key
elements - i.e. this requests save of a subtree for each entry of the
corresponding list. For `MAAPI_CONFIG_XML` and `MAAPI_CONFIG_XML_PRETTY`
it is alternatively possible to give an XPath filter, by including the
flag `MAAPI_CONFIG_XPATH`.

If for example `fmtpath` is "/aaa:aaa/authentication/users" we dump a
subtree of the AAA data, while if it is
"/aaa:aaa/authentication/users/user/homedir", we dump only the homedir
leaf for each user in the AAA data. If `fmtpath` is NULL, the entire
configuration is dumped, except that namespaces with restricted export
(from `tailf:export`) are treated as follows:

- When the `MAAPI_CONFIG_XML` or `MAAPI_CONFIG_XML_PRETTY` formats are
  used, the context of the user session that started the transaction is
  used to select namespaces with restricted export. If the "system"
  context is used, all namespaces are selected, regardless of export
  restriction.

- When one of the CLI formats is used, the context used to select
  namespaces with restricted export is always "cli".

By default, the treatment of nodes with a `tailf:hidden` statement
depends on the state of the transaction. For a transaction started via
MAAPI, no nodes are hidden, while for a transaction started by another
northbound agent (e.g. CLI) and attached to, the nodes that are hidden
are the same as in that agent session. The default can be overridden by
using one of the flags:

- `MAAPI_FLAG_HIDE_ALL_HIDEGROUPS` use with `maapi_start_trans_flags()`.

- `MAAPI_CONFIG_HIDE_ALL` use with `maapi_save_config()` and
  `maapi_load_config()`.

- `MAAPI_CONFIG_UNHIDE_ALL` use with `maapi_save_config()` and
  `maapi_load_config()`.

The function returns `CONFD_ERR` on error or a positive integer id that
can subsequently be used together with `confd_stream_connect()`. Thus
this function doesn't save the configuration to a file, but rather it
returns an integer than is used together with a ConfD stream socket.
ConfD will write all data in a stream on that socket and when done,
ConfD will close its end of the socket. Thus the following code snippet
indicates the usage pattern of this function.

<div class="informalexample">

    int id;
    int streamsock;
    struct sockaddr_in addr;

    id = maapi_save_config(sock, th, flags, path);
    if (id < 0) {
        ... handle error ...
    }

    addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("127.0.0.1");
    addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    addr.sin_port = htons(CONFD_PORT);

    streamsock = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    confd_stream_connect(streamsock, (struct sockaddr*)&addr,
                          sizeof(struct sockaddr_in), id, 0);

</div>

Once the stream socket is connected we can read the configuration data
on the socket. We need to continue reading until we receive EOF on the
socket. To check if the configuration retrieval was successful we use
the function `maapi_save_config_result()`.

The stream socket must be connected within 10 seconds after the id is
received.

>

    int maapi_save_config_result(
    int sock, int id);

We use this function to verify that we received the entire configuration
over the stream socket. The `sock` parameter must be the same maapi
socket we used for `maapi_save_config()` and the `id` parameter is the
`id` returned by `maapi_save_config()`.

    int maapi_load_config(
    int sock, int thandle, int flags, const char *filename);

This function loads a configuration from `filename` into ConfD. The `th`
parameter is a transaction handle. This can be either for a transaction
created by the application, in which case the application must also
apply the transaction, or for an attached transaction (which must not be
applied by the application). The format of the file can be either XML,
curly bracket Juniper CLI format, Cisco XR style format, or Cisco IOS
style format. The caller of the function has to indicate which it is by
using one of the `MAAPI_CONFIG_XML`, `MAAPI_CONFIG_J`, `MAAPI_CONFIG_C`,
`MAAPI_CONFIG_TURBO_C`, or `MAAPI_CONFIG_C_IOS` flags, with the same
meanings as for `maapi_save_config()`. If the name of the file ends in
.gz (or .Z) then the file is assumed to be gzipped, and will be
uncompressed as it is loaded.

> **Note**  
>  
> If you use a relative pathname for `filename`, it is taken as relative
> to the working directory of the ConfD daemon, i.e. the directory where
> the daemon was started.

By default the complete configuration (as allowed by the user of the
current transaction) is deleted before the file is loaded. To merge the
contents of the file use the `MAAPI_CONFIG_MERGE` flag. To replace only
the part of the configuration that is present in the file, use the
`MAAPI_CONFIG_REPLACE` flag.

If the transaction `th` is started against the data store
`CONFD_OPERATIONAL` config false data is loaded. The existing config
false data is not deleted before the file is loaded. Rather it is the
responsibility of the client.

The only supported format for loading 'config false' data is
`MAAPI_CONFIG_XML`.

Additional flags for `MAAPI_CONFIG_XML`:

`MAAPI_CONFIG_WITH_OPER`  
> Any operational data in the file should be ignored (instead of
> producing an error).

`MAAPI_CONFIG_XML_LOAD_LAX`  
> Lax loading. Ignore unknown namespaces, elements, and attributes.

`MAAPI_CONFIG_OPER_ONLY`  
> Load *only* operational data, and ancestors to operational data nodes.

Additional flag for `MAAPI_CONFIG_C` and `MAAPI_CONFIG_C_IOS`:

`MAAPI_CONFIG_AUTOCOMMIT`  
> A commit should be performed after each line. In this case the
> transaction identified by `th` is not used for the loading.

`MAAPI_CONFIG_NO_BACKQUOTE`  
> No special treatment is given go back quotes, ie \\ when parsing the
> commands. This means that certain string values cannot be entered, eg
> \n, \t, but also that no quoting is needed for backslash.

Additional flags for all CLI formats, i.e. `MAAPI_CONFIG_J`,
`MAAPI_CONFIG_C`, and `MAAPI_CONFIG_C_IOS`:

`MAAPI_CONFIG_CONTINUE_ON_ERROR`  
> Do not abort the load when an error is encountered.

`MAAPI_CONFIG_SUPPRESS_ERRORS`  
> Do not display the long error message but instead a oneline error with
> the line number.

The other `flags` parameters are the same as for `maapi_save_config()`,
however the flags `MAAPI_CONFIG_WITH_SERVICE_META`,
`MAAPI_CONFIG_NO_PARENTS`, and `MAAPI_CONFIG_CDB_ONLY` are ignored.

This function loads a configuration like `maapi_load_config()`, but

The `th` and `flags` parameters are the same as for
`maapi_load_config()`.

An optional `chroot` path can be given.

    int maapi_load_config_stream(
    int sock, int thandle, int flags);

This function loads a configuration like `maapi_load_config()`, but
reads the configuration from a ConfD stream socket instead of from a
file. The `th` and `flags` parameters are the same as for
`maapi_load_config()`.

The function returns `CONFD_ERR` on error or a positive integer id that
can subsequently be used together with `confd_stream_connect()`. ConfD
will read all data from the stream socket until it receives EOF. Thus
the following code snippet indicates the usage pattern of this function.

<div class="informalexample">

    int id;
    int streamsock;
    struct sockaddr_in addr;

    id = maapi_load_config_stream(sock, th, flags);

    confd_stream_connect(streamsock, (struct sockaddr*)&addr,
                          sizeof(struct sockaddr_in), id, 0);

</div>

Once the stream socket is connected we can write the configuration data
on the socket. When we have written the complete configuration, we must
close the socket, to make ConfD receive EOF. To check if the
configuration load was successful we use the function
`maapi_load_config_stream_result()`.

The stream socket must be connected within 10 seconds after the id is
received.

    int maapi_load_config_stream_result(
    int sock, int id);

We use this function to verify that the configuration we wrote on the
stream socket was successfully loaded. The `sock` parameter must be the
same maapi socket we used for `maapi_load_config_stream()` and the `id`
parameter is the `id` returned by `maapi_load_config_stream()`.

    int maapi_roll_config(
    int sock, int thandle, const char *fmtpath, ...);

This function can be used to save the equivalent of a rollback file for
a given configuration before it is committed (or a subtree thereof) in
curly bracket format.

The provided path indicates where we want the configuration to be
rooted. It must be a prefix prepended keypath. If `fmtpath` is NULL, a
rollback config for the entire configuration is dumped. If for example
`fmtpath` is "/aaa:aaa/authentication/users" we create a rollback config
for a part of the AAA data. It is not possible to extract non-config
data using this function.

The function returns `CONFD_ERR` on error or a positive integer id that
can subsequently be used together with `confd_stream_connect()`. Thus
this function doesn't save the rollback configuration to a file, but
rather it returns an integer that is used together with a ConfD stream
socket. ConfD will write all data in a stream on that socket and when
done, ConfD will close its end of the socket. Thus the following code
snippet indicates the usage pattern of this function.

</div>

Once the stream socket is connected we can read the configuration data
on the socket. We need to continue reading until we receive EOF on the
socket. To check if the configuration retrieval was successful we use
the function `maapi_roll_config_result()`.

The stream socket must be connected within 10 seconds after the id is
received.

    int maapi_roll_config_result(
    int sock, int id);

We use this function to assert that we received the entire rollback
configuration over a stream socket. The `sock` parameter must be the
same maapi socket we used for `maapi_roll_config()` and the `id`
parameter is the `id` returned by `maapi_roll_config()`.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_ACCESS_DENIED,
CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL

    int maapi_get_stream_progress(
    int sock, int id);

In some cases (e.g. an action or custom command that can be interrupted
by the user) it may be useful to be able to terminate ConfD's reading of
data from a stream socket (by closing the socket) without waiting for a
potentially large amount of data written to the socket to be consumed by
ConfD. This function allows us to limit the amount of data "in flight"
between the application and ConfD, by reporting the amount of data read
by ConfD so far.

The `sock` parameter must be the maapi socket used for a function call
that required a stream socket for writing to ConfD (currently the only
such function is `maapi_load_config_stream()`), and the `id` parameter
is the `id` returned by that function. `maapi_get_stream_progress()`
returns the number of bytes that ConfD has read from the stream socket.
If `id` does not identify a stream socket that is currently being read
by ConfD, the function returns CONFD_ERR with `confd_errno` set to
CONFD_ERR_NOEXISTS. This can be due to e.g. that the socket has been
closed, or that an error has occurred - but also that ConfD has
determined that all the data has been read (e.g. the end of an XML
document has been read). To avoid the latter case, the function should
only be called when we have more data to write, and before the writing
of that data. The following code shows a possible way to use this
function.

<div class="informalexample">

    #define MAX_IN_FLIGHT 4096

    char buf[BUFSIZ];
    int sock, streamsock, id;
    int n, n_written = 0, n_read = 0;
    int result;
    ...

    while (!do_abort() && (n = get_data(buf, sizeof(buf))) > 0) {
        while (n_written - n_read > MAX_IN_FLIGHT) {
            if ((n_read = maapi_get_stream_progress(sock, id)) < 0) {
                ... handle error ...
            }
        }
        if (write(streamsock, buf, n) != n) {
            ... handle error ...
        }
        n_written += n;
    }
    close(streamsock);
    result = maapi_load_config_stream_result(sock, id);

</div>

    int maapi_xpath_eval(
    int sock, int thandle, const char *expr, int (*result
          kp, confd_value_t *v, 
    void *state, void (*trace, void *initstate, const char *fmtpath, ...);

This function evaluates the XPath Path expression as supplied in `expr`.
For each node in the resulting node set the function `result` is called
with the keypath to the resulting node as the first argument, and, if
the node is a leaf and has a value, the value of that node as the second
argument. The expression will be evaluated using the root node as the
context node, unless a path to an existing node is given as the last
argument. For each invocation the `result()` function should return
`ITER_CONTINUE` to tell the XPath evaluator to continue with the next
resulting node. To stop the evaluation the `result()` can return
`ITER_STOP` instead.

The `trace` is a pointer to a function that takes a single string as
argument. If supplied it will be invoked when the xpath implementation
has trace output for the current expression. (For an easy start, for
example the `puts(3)` will print the trace output to stdout). If no
trace is wanted `NULL` can be given.

The `initstate` parameter can be used for any user supplied opaque data
(i.e. whatever is supplied as `initstate` is passed as `state` to the
`result()` function for each invocation).

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADPATH,
CONFD_ERR_XPATH

    int maapi_xpath_eval_expr(
    int sock, int thandle, const char *expr, char **res, void (*trace, const char *fmtpath, 
    ...);

Evaluate the XPath expression given in `expr` and return the result as a
string, pointed to by `res`. If the call succeeds, `res` will point to a
malloc:ed string that the caller needs to free. If the call fails `res`
will be set to `NULL`.

It is possible to supply a path which will be treated as the initial
context node when evaluating `expr` (i.e. if the path is relative, this
is treated as the starting point, and this is also the node that
`current()` will return when used in the XPath expression). If NULL is
given, the current maapi position is used.

The `trace` is a pointer to a function that takes a single string as
argument. If supplied it will be invoked when the xpath implementation
has trace output for the current expression. (For an easy start, for
example the `puts(3)` will print the trace output to stdout). If no
trace is wanted `NULL` can be given.

    int maapi_query_start(
    int sock, int thandle, const char *expr, const char *context_node, int chunk_size, 
    int initial_offset, enum confd_query_result_type result_as, int nselect, 
    const char *select[], int nsort, const char *sort[]);

Start a new query attached to the transaction given in `th`. If
successful a query handle is returned (the query handle is then used in
subsequent calls to `maapi_query_result()` etc). Brief summary of all
parameters:

`sock`  
> A previously opened maapi socket.

`th`  
> A transaction handle to a previously started transaction.

`expr`  
> The primary XPath expression.

`context_node`  
> The context node (an ikeypath) for the primary expression. `NULL` is
> legal, and means that the context node will be `/`.

`chunk_size`  
> How many results to return at a time. If set to 0 a default number
> will be used.

`initial_offset`  
> Which result in line to begin with (1 means to start from the
> begining).

`result_as`  
> The format the results will be returned in.

`nselect`  
> The number of expressions in the `select` parameter.

`select`  
> An array of XPath "select" expressions, of length `nselect`.

`nsort`  
> The number of expressions in the `sort` parameter.

`sort`  
> An array of XPath expressions which will be used for sorting, of
> length `nselect`.

A query is a way of evaluating an XPath expression and returning the
results in chunks. The usage pattern is as follows: a primary expression
in provided in the `expr` argument, which must evaluate to a node-set,
the "results". For each node in the results node-set every "select"
expression is evaluated with the result node as its context node. For
example, given the YANG snippet:

<div class="informalexample">

      list interface {
        key name;
        unique number;
        leaf name {
          type string;
        }
        leaf number {
          type uint32;
          mandatory true;
        }
        leaf enabled {
          type boolean;
          default true;
        }
      ...
      }

</div>

and given that we want to find the name and number of all enabled
interfaces - the `expr` could be `"/interface[enabled='true']"`, and the
select expressions would be `{ "name", "number" }`. Note that the select
expressions can have any valid XPath expression, so if you wanted to
find out an interfaces name, and whether its number is even or not, the
expressions would be: `{ "name", "(number mod 2) == 0" }`.

The results are then fetched using the `maapi_query_result()` function,
which returns the results on the format specified by the `result_as`
parameter. There are four different types of result, as defined by the
type `enum confd_query_result_type`:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
enum confd_query_result_type {
    CONFD_QUERY_STRING = 0,
    CONFD_QUERY_HKEYPATH = 1,
    CONFD_QUERY_HKEYPATH_VALUE = 2,
    CONFD_QUERY_TAG_VALUE = 3
};
```

</div>

I.e. the results can be returned as strings, hkeypaths, hkeypaths and
values, or tags and values. The string is just the resulting string of
evaluating the select XPath expression. For hkeypaths, tags, and values
it is the path/tag/value of the *node that the select XPath expression
evaluates to*. This means that care must be taken so that the
combination of select expression and return types actually yield
sensible results (for example "1 + 2" is a valid select XPath
expression, and would result in the string "3" when setting the result
type to `CONFD_QUERY_STRING` - but it is not a node, and thus have no
hkeypath, tag, or value). A complete example:

<div class="informalexample">

      qh = maapi_query_start(s, th, "/interface[enabled='true']", NULL,
                             1000, 1, CONFD_QUERY_TAG_VALUE,
                             2, (char *[]){ "name", "number" }, 0, NULL);
      n = 0;
      do {
        maapi_query_result(s, qh, &qr);
        n = qr->nresults;
        for (i=0; i<n; i++) {
          printf("result %d:\n", i + qr->offset);
          for (j=0; j<qr->nelements; j++) {
            // We know the type is tag-value
            char *tag = confd_hash2str(qr->results[i].tv[j].tag.tag);
            confd_pp_value(tmpbuf, BUFSIZ, &qr->results[i].tv[j].v);
            printf("  %s: %s\n", tag, tmpbuf);
          }
        }
        maapi_query_free_result(qr);
      } while (n > 0);
      maapi_query_stop(s, qh);
         

</div>

It is possible to sort the results using the built-in XPath function
`sort-by()` (see the
[tailf_yang_extensions(5)](section5.md#tailf_yang_extensions) man page)

It is also possible to sort the result using any expressions passed in
the `sort` array. These array will be used to construct a temporary
index which will live as long as the query is active. For example to
start a query sorting first on the enabled leaf, and then on number one
would call:

<div class="informalexample">

    qh = maapi_query_start(s, th, "/interface[enabled='true']", NULL,
                           1000, 1, CONFD_QUERY_TAG_VALUE,
                           3, (char *[]){ "name", "number", "enabled" },
                           2, (char *[]){ "enabled", "number" });
    ...
         

</div>

Note that the index the query constructs is kept in memory, which will
be released when the query is stopped.

    int maapi_query_result(
    int sock, int qh, struct confd_query_result **qrs);

Fetch the next available chunk of results associated with query handle
`qh`. The results are returned in a `struct confd_query_result`, which
is allocated by the library. The structure is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_query_result {
    enum confd_query_result_type type;
    int offset;
    int nresults;
    int nelements;
    union {
        char **str;
        confd_hkeypath_t *hkp;
        struct {
            confd_hkeypath_t hkp;
            confd_value_t    val;
        } *kv;
        confd_tag_value_t *tv;
    } *results;
    void *__internal;           /* confd_lib internal housekeeping */
};
```

</div>

The `type` will always be the same as was requested in the call to
`maapi_query_start()`, it is there to indicate which of the pointers in
the union to use. The `offset` is the number of the first result in this
chunk (i.e. for the first chunk it will be 1). How many results that are
in this chunk is indicated in `nresults`, when there are no more
available results it will be set to 0. Each result consists of
`nelements` elements (this number is the same as the number of select
parameters given in the call to `maapi_query_start()`.

All data pointed to in the result struct (as well as the struct itself)
is allocated by the library - and when finished processing the result
the user must call `maapi_query_free_result()` to free this data.

    int maapi_query_free_result(
    struct confd_query_result *qrs);

The `struct confd_query_result` returned by `maapi_query_result()` is
dynamically allocated (and it also contains pointers to other
dynamically allocated data) and so it needs to be freed when the result
has been processed. Use this function to free the
`struct confd_query_result` (and its accompanying data) returned by
`maapi_query_result()`.

    int maapi_query_reset(
    int sock, int qh);

Reset / rewind a running query so that it starts from the beginning
again. Next call to `maapi_query_result()` will then return the first
chunk of results. The function can be called at any time (i.e. both
after all results have been returned to essentially run the same query
again, as well as after fetching just one or a couple of results).

    int maapi_query_reset_to(
    int sock, int qh, int offset);

Like `maapi_query_reset()`, except after the query has been reset it is
restarted with the initial offset set to `offset`. Next call to
`maapi_query_result()` will then return the first chunk of results at
that offset. The function can be called at any time (i.e. both after all
results have been returned to essentially run the same query again, as
well as after fetching just one or a couple of results).

    int maapi_query_stop(
    int sock, int qh);

Stops the running query identified by `qh`, and makes ConfD free up any
internal resources associated with the query. If a query isn't
explicitly closed using this call it will be cleaned up when the
transaction the query is linked to ends.

    int maapi_install_crypto_keys(
    int sock);

It is possible to define DES3 and AES keys inside confd.conf. These keys
are used by ConfD to encrypt data which is entered into the system. The
supported types are `tailf:des3-cbc-encrypted-string`,
`tailf:aes-cfb-128-encrypted-string` and
`tailf:aes-256-cfb-128-encrypted-string`. See
[confd_types(3)](section3.md#confd_types).

This function will copy those keys from ConfD (which reads confd.conf)
into memory in the library. To decrypt data of these types, use the
function `confd_decrypt()`, see
[confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib).

    int maapi_do_display(
    int sock, int thandle, const char *fmtpath, ...);

If the data model uses the YANG `when` or `tailf:display-when`
statement, this function can be used to determine if the item given by
`fmtpath, ...` should be displayed or not.

    int maapi_init_upgrade(
    int sock, int timeoutsecs, int flags);

This is the first of three functions that must be called in sequence to
perform an in-service data model upgrade, i.e. replace fxs files etc
without restarting the ConfD daemon.

This function initializes the upgrade procedure. The `timeoutsecs`
parameter specifies a maximum time to wait for users to voluntarily exit
from "configure mode" sessions in CLI and Web UI. If transactions are
still active when the timeout expires, the function will by default fail
with CONFD_ERR_TIMEOUT. If the flag MAAPI_UPGRADE_KILL_ON_TIMEOUT was
given via the `flags` parameter, such transactions will instead be
forcibly terminated, allowing the initialization to complete
successfully.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_LOCKED,
CONFD_ERR_BADSTATE, CONFD_ERR_HA_WITH_UPGRADE, CONFD_ERR_TIMEOUT,
CONFD_ERR_ABORTED

    int maapi_perform_upgrade(
    int sock, const char **loadpathdirs, int n);

When `maapi_init_upgrade()` has completed successfully, this function
must be called to instruct ConfD to load the new data model files. The
`loadpathdirs` parameter is an array of `n` strings that specify the
directories to load from, corresponding to the /confdConfig/loadPath/dir
elements in `confd.conf` (see [confd.conf(5)](section5.md#ncs.conf)).

These directories will also be searched for CDB "init files" (see the
CDB chapter in the Development Guide). I.e. if the upgrade needs such
files, we can place them in one of the new load path directories - or we
can include directories that are used *only* for CDB "init files" in the
`loadpathdirs` array, corresponding to the /confdConfig/cdb/initPath/dir
elements that can be specified in `confd.conf`.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADSTATE,
CONFD_ERR_BAD_CONFIG

    int maapi_commit_upgrade(
    int sock);

When also `maapi_perform_upgrade()` has completed successfully, this
function must be called to make the upgrade permanent. This includes
committing the CDB upgrade transaction when CDB is used, and we can thus
get all the different validation errors that can otherwise result from
`maapi_apply_trans()`.

When `maapi_commit_upgrade()` has completed successfully, the program
driving the upgrade must also make sure that the
/confdConfig/loadPath/dir elements in `confd.conf` reference the new
directories. If CDB "init files" are used in the upgrade as described
for `maapi_commit_upgrade()` above, the program should also make sure
that the /confdConfig/cdb/initPath/dir elements reference the
directories where those files are located.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADSTATE,
CONFD_ERR_NOTSET, CONFD_ERR_NON_UNIQUE, CONFD_ERR_BAD_KEYREF,

CONFD_ERR_UNSET_CHOICE, CONFD_ERR_MUST_FAILED,
CONFD_ERR_MISSING_INSTANCE, CONFD_ERR_INVALID_INSTANCE,
CONFD_ERR_STALE_INSTANCE, CONFD_ERR_BADTYPE, CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL

    int maapi_abort_upgrade(
    int sock);

Calling this function at any point before the call of
`maapi_commit_upgrade()` will abort the upgrade.

> **Note**  
>  
> `maapi_abort_upgrade()` should *not* be called if any of the three
> previous functions fail - in that case, ConfD will do an internal
> abort of the upgrade.

### Confd Daemon Control

    int maapi_aaa_reload(
    int sock, int synchronous);

When the ConfD AAA tree is populated by an external data provider (see
the AAA chapter in the Admin Guide), this function can be used by the
data provider to notify ConfD when there is a change to the AAA data.
I.e. it is an alternative to executing the command
`confd --clear-aaa-cache`.

If the `synchronous` parameter is 0, the function will only initiate the
loading of the AAA data, just like `confd --clear-aaa-cache` does, and
return CONFD_OK as long as the communication with ConfD succeeded.
Otherwise it will wait for the loading to complete, and return CONFD_OK
only if the loading was successful.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL

    int maapi_aaa_reload_path(
    int sock, int synchronous, const char *fmt, ...);

A variant of `maapi_aaa_reload()` that causes only the AAA subtree given
by the path in `fmt` to be loaded. This may be useful to load changes to
the AAA data when loading the complete AAA tree from an external data
provider takes a long time. Obviously care must be taken to make sure
that all changes actually get loaded, and a complete load using e.g.
`maapi_aaa_reload()` should be done at least when ConfD is started. The
path may specify a container or list entry, but not a specific leaf.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL

    int maapi_snmpa_reload(
    int sock, int synchronous);

When the ConfD SNMP Agent config is implemented by an external data
provider, this function must be used by the data provider to notify
ConfD when there is a change to the data.

If the `synchronous` parameter is 0, the function will only initiate the
loading of the data, and return CONFD_OK as long as the communication
with ConfD succeeded. Otherwise it will wait for the loading to
complete, and return CONFD_OK only if the loading was successful.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_EXTERNAL

    int maapi_start_phase(
    int sock, int phase, int synchronous);

Once the ConfD daemon has been started in phase0 it is possible to use
this function to tell the daemon to proceed to startphase 1 or 2 (as
indicated in the `phase` parameter). If `synchronous` is non-zero the
call does not return until the daemon has completed the transition to
the requested start phase.

Note that start-phase1 can fail, (see documentation of `--start-phase1`
in [confd(1)](section1.md#ncs)) in particular if CDB fails. In that case
`maapi_start_phase()` will return CONFD_ERR, with confderrno set to
CONFD_ERR_START_FAILED. However if ConfD stops before it has a chance to
send back the error CONFD_EOF might be returned.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_START_FAILED

    int maapi_wait_start(
    int sock, int phase);

To synchronize startup with ConfD this function can be used to wait for
ConfD to reach a particular start phase (0, 1, or 2). Note that to
implement an equivalent of [`confd --wait-started`](section1.md#ncs) or
[`confd --wait-phase0`](section1.md#ncs) case must also be taken to retry
`maapi_connect()`, which will fail until ConfD has started enough to
accept connections to its IPC port.

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_PROTOUSAGE

    int maapi_stop(
    int sock, int synchronous);

Request the ConfD daemon to stop, if `synchronous` is non-zero the call
will wait until ConfD has come to a complete halt. Note that since the
daemon exits, the socket won't be re-usable after this call. Equivalent
to [ `confd --stop`](section1.md#ncs).

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

    int maapi_reload_config(
    int sock);

Request that the ConfD daemon reloads its configuration files. The
daemon will also close and re-open its log files. Equivalent to
[`confd --reload`](section1.md#ncs).

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

    int maapi_reopen_logs(
    int sock);

Request that the ConfD daemon closes and re-opens its log files, useful
for logrotate(8).

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS

    int maapi_rebind_listener(
    int sock, int listener);

Request that the subsystem(s) specified by `listener` rebinds its
listener socket(s). Currently open sockets (if any) will be closed, and
new sockets created and bound via `bind(2)` and `listen(2)`. This is
useful e.g. if /confdConfig/ignoreBindErrors/enabled is set to "true" in
`confd.conf`, and some bindings have failed due to a problem that
subsequently has been fixed. Calling this function then avoids the
disable/enable config change that would otherwise be required to cause a
rebind.

The following values can be used for the `listener` parameter, ORed
together if more than one:

<div class="informalexample">

    #define CONFD_LISTENER_IPC             (1 << 0)
    #define CONFD_LISTENER_NETCONF         (1 << 1)
    #define CONFD_LISTENER_SNMP            (1 << 2)
    #define CONFD_LISTENER_CLI             (1 << 3)
    #define CONFD_LISTENER_WEBUI           (1 << 4)
    #define NCS_LISTENER_NETCONF_CALL_HOME (1 << 5)

</div>

> **Note**

*Errors*: CONFD_ERR_MALLOC, CONFD_ERR_OS, CONFD_ERR_BADSTATE

    int maapi_clear_opcache(
    int sock, const char *fmt, ...);

Request clearing of the operational data cache. A path can be given via
the `fmt` and subsequent parameters, to clear only the cached data for
the subtree designated by that path. To clear the whole cache, pass NULL
or "/" for `fmt`.

    int maapi_netconf_ssh_call_home(
    int sock, confd_value_t *host, int port);

Request that ConfD daemon initiates a NETCONF SSH Call Home connection
(see RFC 8071) to the NETCONF client running on `host` and listening on
`port`.

The parameter `host` is either an IP address (C_IPV4 or C_IPV6) or a
host name (C_BUF or C_STR).

    int maapi_netconf_ssh_call_home_opaque(
    int sock, confd_value_t *host, const char *opaque, int port);

Request that ConfD daemon initiates a NETCONF SSH Call Home connection
(see RFC 8071) to the NETCONF client running on `host` passing an opaque
value `opaque` the client listening on `port`.

The parameter `host` is either an IP address (C_IPV4 or C_IPV6) or a
host name (C_BUF or C_STR).

### Synopsis

    #include <confd_lib.h>

### Description

The `libconfd` library manages data values such as elements received
over the NETCONF protocol. This man page describes how these values as
well as the XML paths (`confd_hkeypath_t`) identifying the values are
represented in the C language.

### Typedefs

The following `enum` defines the different types. These are used to
represent data model types from several different sources - see the
section [DATA MODEL TYPES](section3.md#confd_types.data_model) at the end of
this manual page for a full specification of how the data model types
map to these types.

### Xml Paths

Almost all of the callback functions the user is supposed write for the
[confd_lib_dp(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_dp) library takes a parameter of type
`confd_hkeypath_t`. This type includes an array of the type
`confd_value_t` described above. The `confd_hkeypath_t` is defined as a
C struct:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
typedef struct confd_hkeypath {
    int len;
    confd_value_t v[MAXDEPTH][MAXKEYLEN];
} confd_hkeypath_t;
```

</div>

Where:

<div class="informalexample">

    #define MAXDEPTH 20   /* max depth of data model tree
                             (max KP length + 1) */
    #define MAXKEYLEN 9   /* max number of key elems
                             (max keys + 1) */

</div>

For example, assume we have a YANG module with:

<div class="informalexample">

    container servers {
      tailf:callpoint mycp;
      list server {
        key name;
        max-elements 64;
        leaf name {
          type string;
        }
        leaf ip {
          type inet:ip-address;
        }
        leaf port {
          type inet:port-number;
        }
      }
    }

</div>

Assuming a server entry with the name "www" exists, then the path
/servers/server{www}/ip is valid and identifies the ip leaf in the
server entry whose key is "www".

The `confd_hkeypath_t` which corresponds to /servers/server{www}/ip is
received in reverse order so the following holds assuming the variable
holding a pointer to the keypath is called `hkp`.

`hkp->v[0][0]` is the last element, the "ip" element. It is a data model
node, and `CONFD_GET_XMLTAG(&hkp->v[0][0])` will evaluate to a hashed
integer (which can be found in the confdc generated .h file as a
\#define)

`hkp->v[1][0]` is the next element in the path. The key element is
called "name". This is a `string` value - thus
`strcmp("www", CONFD_GET_BUFPTR(&hkp->v[1][0])) == 0` holds.

If we had chosen to use multiple keys in our data model - for example if
we had chosen to use both the "name" and the "ip" leafs as keys:

<div class="informalexample">

    key "name ip";

</div>

The hkeypaths would be different since two keys are required. A valid
path identifying a port leaf would be /servers/server{www
10.2.3.4}/port. In this case we can get to the ip part of the key with:

<div class="informalexample">

    struct in_addr ip;
    ip = CONFD_GET_IPV4(&hkp->v[1][1])

</div>

### User-Defined Types

We can define new types in addition to those listed in the TYPEDEFS
section above. This can be useful if none of the predefined types, nor a
derivation of one of those types via standard YANG restrictions, is
suitable. Of course it is always possible to define a type as a
derivation of `string` and have the application parse the string
whenever a value needs to be processed, but with a user-defined type
ConfD will do the string \<-\> value translation just as for the
predefined types.

A user-defined type will always have a value representation that uses a
confd_value_t with one of the `enum confd_vtype` values listed above,
but the textual representation and the range(s) of allowed values are
defined by the user. The `misc/user_type` example in the collection
delivered with the ConfD release shows implementation of several
user-defined types - it will be useful to refer to it for the
description below.

The choice of `confd_vtype` to use for the value representation can be
whatever suits the actual data values best, with one exception:

> **Note**  
>  
> The C_LIST `confd_vtype` value can *not* be used for a leaf that is a
> key in a YANG list. The "normal" C_LIST usage is only for
> representation of leaf-lists, and a leaf-list can of course not be a
> key. Thus the ConfD code is not prepared to handle this kind of
> "value" for a key. It is a strong recommendation to *never* use C_LIST
> for a user-defined type, since even if the type is not initially used
> for key leafs, subsequent development may see a need for this, at
> which point it may be cumbersome to change to a different
> representation.

The example uses C_INT32, C_IPV4PREFIX, and C_IPV6PREFIX for the value
representation of the respective types, but in many cases the opaque
byte array provided by C_BINARY will be most suitable - this can e.g. be
mapped to/from an arbitrary C struct.

When we want to implement a user-defined type, we need to specify the
type as `string`, and add a `tailf:typepoint` statement - see
[tailf_yang_extensions(5)](section5.md#tailf_yang_extensions). We can use
`tailf:typepoint` wherever a built-in or derived type can be specified,
i.e. as sub-statement to `typedef`, `leaf`, or `leaf-list`:

<div class="informalexample">

    typedef myType {
      type string;
      tailf:typepoint my_type;
    }

    container c {
      leaf one {
        type myType;
      }
      leaf two {
        type string;
        tailf:typepoint two_type;
      }
    }

</div>

The argument to the `tailf:typepoint` statement is used to locate the
type implementation, similar to how "callpoints" are used to locate data
providers, but the actual mechanism is different, as described below.

To actually implement the type definition, we need to write three
callback functions that are defined in the `struct confd_type`:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_type {
    /* If a derived type point at the parent */
    struct confd_type *parent;

    /* not used in confspecs, but used in YANG */
    struct confd_type *defval;

    /* parse value located in str, and validate.
     * returns CONFD_TRUE if value is syntactically correct
     * and CONFD_FALSE otherwise.
     */
    int (*str_to_val)(struct confd_type *self,
                      struct confd_type_ctx *ctx,
                      const char *str, unsigned int len,
                      confd_value_t *v);

    /* print the value to str.
     * does not print more than len bytes, including trailing NUL.
     * return value as snprintf - i.e. if the value is correct for
     * the type, it returns the length of the string form regardless
     * of the len limit - otherwise it returns a negative number.
     * thus, the NUL terminated output has been completely written
     * if and only if the returned value is nonnegative and less
     * than len.
     * If strp is non-NULL and the string form is constant (i.e.
     * C_ENUM_VALUE), a pointer to the string is stored in *strp.
     */
    int (*val_to_str)(struct confd_type *self,
                      struct confd_type_ctx *ctx,
                      const confd_value_t *v,
                      char *str, unsigned int len,
                      const char **strp);

    /* returns CONFD_TRUE if value is correct, otherwise CONFD_FALSE
     */
    int (*validate)(struct confd_type *self,
                    struct confd_type_ctx *ctx,
                    const confd_value_t *v);

    /* data optionally used by the callbacks */
    void *opaque;
};
```

</div>

I.e. `str_to_val()` and `val_to_str()` are responsible for the string to
value and value to string translations, respectively, and `validate()`
may be called to verify that a given value adheres to any restrictions
on the values allowed for the type. The `errstr` element in the
`struct confd_type_ctx *ctx` passed to these functions can be used to
return an error message when the function fails - in this case `errstr`
must be set to the address of a dynamically allocated string. The other
elements in `ctx` are currently unused.

Including user-defined types in a YANG `union` may need some special
consideration. Per the YANG specification, the string form of a value is
matched against the union member types in the order they are specified
until a match is found, and this procedure determines the type of the
value. A corresponding procedure is used by ConfD when the value needs
to be converted to a string, but this conversion does not include any
evaluation of restrictions etc - the values are assumed to be correct
for their type. Thus the `val_to_str()` function for the member types
are tried in order until one succeeds, and the resulting string is used.
This means that a) `val_to_str()` must verify that the value is of the
correct type, i.e. that it has the expected `confd_vtype`, and b) if the
value representation is the same for multiple member types, there is no
guarantee that the same member type as for the string to value
conversion is chosen.

The `opaque` element in the `struct confd_type` can be used for any
auxiliary (static) data needed by the functions (on invocation they can
reference it as self-\>opaque). The `parent` and `defval` elements are
not used in this context, and should be NULL.

> **Note**  
>  
> The `str_to_val()` function *must* allocate space (using e.g.
> malloc(3)) for the actual data value for those confd_value_t types
> that are listed as having allocated data above, i.e. C_BUF, C_QNAME,
> C_LIST, C_OBJECTREF, C_OID, C_BINARY, and C_HEXSTR.

We make the implementation available to ConfD by creating one or more
shared objects (.so files) containing the above callback functions. Each
shared object may implement one or more types, and at startup the ConfD
daemon will search the directories specified for /confdConfig/loadPath
in `confd.conf` for files with a name that match the pattern
"confd_type\*.so" and load them.

Each shared object must also implement an "init" callback:

    int confd_type_cb_init(
    struct confd_type_cbs **cbs);

When the object has been loaded, ConfD will call this function. It must
return a pointer to an array of type callback structures via the `cbs`
argument, and the number of elements in the array as return value. The
`struct confd_type_cbs` is defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
struct confd_type_cbs {
    char *typepoint;
    struct confd_type *type;
};
```

</div>

These structures are then used by ConfD to locate the implementation of
a given type, by searching for a `typepoint` string that matches the
`tailf:typepoint` argument in the YANG data model.

> **Note**  
>  
> Since our callbacks are executed directly by the ConfD daemon, it is
> critically important that they do not have a negative impact on the
> daemon. No other processing can be done by ConfD while the callbacks
> are executed, and e.g. a NULL pointer dereference in one of the
> callbacks will cause ConfD to crash. Thus they should be simple,
> purely algorithmic functions, never referencing any external

> **Note**

> \$CONFD_DIR is the installation directory of ConfD.

The above is enough for ConfD to use the types that we have defined, but
the libconfd library can also do local string\<-\>value translation if
we have loaded the schema information, as described in the [USING SCHEMA
INFORMATION](section3.md#confd_types.using_schema_information) section below.
For this to work for user-defined types, we must register the type
definitions with the library, using one of these functions:

    int confd_register_ns_type(
    uint32_t nshash, const char *name, struct confd_type *type);

Here we must pass the hash value for the namespace where the type is
defined as `nshash`, and the name of the type from a `typedef` statement
(i.e. *not* the typepoint name if they are different) as `name`. Thus we
can not use this function to register a user-defined type that is
specified "inline" in a `leaf` or `leaf-list` statement, since we don't
have a name for the type.

    int confd_register_node_type(
    struct confd_cs_node *node, struct confd_type *type);

This function takes a pointer to a schema node (see the section [USING
SCHEMA INFORMATION](section3.md#confd_types.using_schema_information)) that
uses the type instead of namespace and type name. It is necessary to use
this for registration of user-defined types that are specified "inline",
but it can also be used for user-defined types specified via `typedef`.
In the latter case it will be equivalent to calling
`confd_register_ns_type()` for the typedef, i.e. a single registration
will apply to all nodes using the typedef.

The functions can only be called *after* `confd_load_schemas()` or
`maapi_load_schemas()` (see below) has been called, and if
`confd_load_schemas()`/ `maapi_load_schemas()` is called again, the
registration must be re-done. The `misc/user_type` example shows a way
to use the exact same code for the shared object and for this
registration.

Schema upgrades when the data is stored in CDB requires special
consideration for user-defined types. Normally CDB can handle any type
changes automatically, and this is true also when changing
to/from/between user-defined types, provided that the following
requirements are fulfilled:

1.  A given typepoint name always refers to the exact same
    implementation - i.e. same value representation, same range
    restrictions, etc.

2.  Shared objects providing implementations for all the typepoint ids
    used in the new *and* the old schema are made available to ConfD.

I.e. if we change the implementation of a type, we also change the
typepoint name, and keep the old implementation around. If requirement 1
isn't fulfilled, we can end up with the case of e.g. a changed value
representation between schema versions even though the types are
indistinguishable for CDB. This can still be handled by using MAAPI to
modify CDB during the upgrade as described in the User Guide, but if
that is not done, CDB will just carry the old values over, which in
effect results in a corrupt database.

### Using Schema Information

Schema information from the data model can be loaded from the ConfD
daemon at runtime using the `maapi_load_schemas()` function, see the
[confd_lib_maapi(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_maapi) manual page. Information
for all namespaces loaded into ConfD is then made available. In many
cases it may be more convenient to use the `confd_load_schemas()`
utility function. For details about this function and those discussed
below, see [confd_lib_lib(3)](section3.md#confd_lib_lib). After loading the
data, we can call `confd_get_nslist()` to find which namespaces are
known to the library as a result.

Note that all pointers returned (directly or indirectly) by the
functions discussed here reference dynamically allocated memory
maintained by the library - they will become invalid if
`confd_load_schemas()` or `maapi_load_schemas()` is subsequently called
again.

The [confdc(1)](section1.md#confdc) compiler can also optionally generate a C
header file that has \#define symbols for the integer values
corresponding to data model nodes and enumerations.

When the schema information has been made available to the library, we
can format an arbitrary instance of a `confd_value_t` value using
`confd_pp_value()` or `confd_ns_pp_value()`, or an arbitrary hkeypath
using `confd_pp_kpath()` or `confd_xpath_pp_kpath()`. We can also get a
pointer to the string representing a data model node using
`confd_hash2str()`.

Furthermore a tree representation of the data model is available, which
contains a `struct confd_cs_node` for every node in the data model.
There is one tree for each namespace that has toplevel elements.

    struct confd_cs_meta_data {

        struct confd_cs_choice *parent;
        struct confd_cs_case *next;
        struct confd_cs_choice *choices;
    };

</div>

Each `confd_cs_node` is linked to its related nodes: `parent` is a
pointer to the parent node, `next` is a pointer to the next sibling
node, and `children` is a pointer to the first child node - for each of
these, a NULL pointer has the obvious meaning.

Each `confd_cs_node` also contains an information structure: For a list
node, the `keys` field is a zero-terminated array of integers - these
are the `tag` values for the children nodes that are key elements. This
makes it possible to find the name of a key element in a keypath. If the
`confd_cs_node` is not a list node, the `keys` field is NULL. The
`shallow_type` field gives the "primitive" type for the element, i.e.
the `enum confd_vtype` value that is used in the `confd_value_t`
representation.

Typed leaf nodes also carry a complete type definition via the `type`
pointer, which can be used with the `conf_str2val()` and
`confd_val2str()` functions, as well as the leaf's default value (if
any) via the `defval` pointer.

If the YANG `choice` statement is used in the data model, additional
structures are created by the schema loading. For list and container
nodes that have `choice` statements, the `choices` element in
`confd_cs_node_info` is a pointer to a linked list of `confd_cs_choice`
structures representing the choices. Each `confd_cs_choice` has a
pointer to the parent node and a `cases` pointer to a linked list of
`confd_cs_case` structures representing the cases for that choice.
Finally, each `confd_cs_case` structure has pointers to the parent
`confd_cs_choice` structure, and to the `confd_cs_node` structures
representing the first and last element in the case. Those
`confd_cs_node` structures, i.e. the "toplevel" elements of a case, have
the CS_NODE_IS_CASE flag set. Note that it is possible for a case to be
"empty", i.e. there are no elements in the case - then the `first` and
`last` pointers in the `confd_cs_case` structure are NULL.

For a list node, the sort order is indicated by the `cmp` element in
`confd_cs_node_info`. The value CS_NODE_CMP_NORMAL means an ordinary,
system ordered, list. CS_NODE_CMP_SNMP is system ordered, but ordered
according to SNMP lexicographical order, and CS_NODE_CMP_SNMP_IMPLIED is
an SNMP lexicographical order where the last key has an IMPLIED keyword.
CS_NODE_CMP_UNSORTED is system ordered, but is not sorted. The value
CS_NODE_CMP_USER denotes an "ordered-by user" list.

If the `tailf:meta-data` extension is used for a node, the `meta_data`
element points to an array of `struct confd_cs_meta_data`, otherwise it
is NULL. In the array, the `key` element is the argument of
`tailf:meta-data`, and the `value` element is the argument of the
`tailf:meta-value` substatement, if any - otherwise it is NULL. The end
of the array is indicated by a struct where the `key` element is NULL.

Action and notification specifications are included in the tree in the
same way as the config/data elements - they are indicated by the
CS_NODE_IS_ACTION flag being set on the action node, and the
CS_NODE_IS_NOTIF flag being set on the notification node, respectively.
Furthermore the nodes corresponding to the sub-statements of the
action's `input` statement have the CS_NODE_IS_PARAM flag set, and those
corresponding to the sub-statements of the action's `output` statement
have the CS_NODE_IS_RESULT flag set. Note that the `input` and `output`
statements do not have corresponding nodes in the tree.

The `confd_find_cs_root()` function returns the root of the tree for a
given namespace, and the `confd_find_cs_node()`,
`confd_find_cs_node_child()`, and `confd_cs_node_cd()` functions are
useful for navigating the tree. Assume that we have the following data
model:

<div class="informalexample">

    container servers {
      list server {
        key name;
        max-elements 64;
        leaf name {
          type string;
        }
        leaf ip {
          type inet:ip-address;
        }
        leaf port {
          type inet:port-number;
        }
      }
    }

</div>

Then, given the keypath /servers/server{www} in `confd_hkeypath_t` form,
a call to `confd_find_cs_node()` would return a `struct confd_cs_node`,
i.e. a pointer into the tree, as in:

<div class="informalexample">

    struct confd_cs_node *csp;
    char *name;
    csp = confd_find_cs_node(mykeypath, mykeypath->len);
    name = confd_hash2str(csp->info.keys[0])

</div>

and the C variable `name` will have the value `"name"`. These functions
make it possible to format keypaths in various ways.

If we have a keypath which identifies a node below the one we are
interested in, such as /servers/server{www}/ip, we can use the `len`
parameter as in `confd_find_cs_node(kp, 3)` where `3` is the length of
the keypath we wish to consider.

The equivalent of the above `confd_find_cs_node()` example, but using a
string keypath, could be written as:

<div class="informalexample">

    csp = confd_cs_node_cd(confd_find_cs_root(mynamespace),
                           "/servers/server{www}");

</div>

The `type` field in the `struct confd_cs_node_info` can be used for data
model aware string \<-\> value translations. E.g. assuming that we have
a `confd_hkeypath_t *kp` representing the element
/servers/server{www}/ip, we can do the following:

<div class="informalexample">

    confd_value_t v;
    csp = confd_find_cs_node(kp, kp->len);
    confd_str2val(csp->info.type, "10.0.0.1", &v);

</div>

The `confd_value_t v` will then be filled in with the corresponding
C_IPV4 value. This technique is generally necessary for translating
C_ENUM_VALUE values to the corresponding strings (or vice versa), since
there isn't a type-independent mapping. But `confd_val2str()` (or
`confd_str2val()`) can always do the translation, since it is given the
full type information. E.g. this will store the string "nonVolatile" in
`buf`:

<div class="informalexample">

    confd_value_t v;
    char buf[64];

    CONFD_SET_ENUM_VALUE(&v, 3);
    root = confd_find_cs_root(SNMP_COMMUNITY_MIB__ns);
    csp = confd_cs_node_cd(root, "/SNMP-COMMUNITY-MIB/snmpCommunityTable/"
                           "snmpCommunityEntry/snmpCommunityStorageType");
    confd_val2str(csp->info.type, &v, buf, sizeof(buf));

</div>

The type information can also be found by using the
`confd_find_ns_type()` function to look up the type name as a string in
the namespace where it is defined - i.e. we could alternatively have
achieved the same result with:

<div class="informalexample">

    CONFD_SET_ENUM_VALUE(&v, 3);
    type = confd_find_ns_type(SNMPv2_TC__ns, "StorageType");
    confd_val2str(type, &v, buf, sizeof(buf));

</div>

If we give `0` for the `nshash` argument to `confd_find_ns_type()`, the
type name will be looked up among the ConfD built-in types (i.e. the
YANG built-in types, the types defined in the YANG "tailf-common"
module, and the types defined in the pre-defined "confd" and/or "xs"
namespaces) - e.g. the type information for /servers/server{www}/name
could be found with `confd_find_ns_type(0, "string")`.

### Xml Structures

Three different methods are used to represent a subtree of data nodes.
["Value Array"](section3.md#confd_types.xml_structures.array) describes a
format that is simpler but has some limitations, while ["Tagged Value
Array"](section3.md#confd_types.xml_structures.tagged_array) and ["Tagged
Value Attribute
Array"](section3.md#confd_types.xml_structures.tagged_attr_array) describe
formats that are more complex but can represent an arbitrary subtree.

#### Value Array

The simpler format is an array of `confd_value_t` elements corresponding
to the complete contents of a list entry or container. The content of
sub-list entries cannot be represented. The array is populated through a
"depth first" traversal of the data tree as follows:

1.  Optional leafs or `presence` containers that do not exist use a
    single array element, with type C_NOEXISTS (value ignored).

2.  List nodes use a single array element, with type C_NOEXISTS (value
    ignored), regardless of the actual number of entries or their
    contents.

3.  Leaf-list nodes use a single array element, with type C_LIST and the
    leaf-list elements as values.

4.  Leafs with a type other than `empty` use an array element with their
    type and value as usual. If type `empty` is placed in a `union`,
    then an array element is still used.

5.  Leafs of type `empty` use an array element with type C_XMLTAG, and
    `tag` and `ns` set according to the leaf name. Unless type `empty`
    is placed in a `union` as per above.

6.  Containers use one array element with type C_XMLTAG, and `tag` and
    `ns` set according to the element name, followed by array elements
    for the sub-nodes according to this list.

Note that the list or container node corresponding to the complete array
is not included in the array, and that there is no array element for the
"end" of a container.

As an example, the array corresponding to the /servers/server{www} list
entry above could be populated as:

<div class="informalexample">

    confd_value_t v[3];
    struct in_addr ip;

    CONFD_SET_STR(&v[0], "www");
    ip.s_addr = inet_addr("192.168.1.2");
    CONFD_SET_IPV4(&v[1], ip);
    CONFD_SET_UINT16(&v[2], 80);

</div>

#### Tagged Value Array

This format uses an array of `confd_tag_value_t` elements. This is a
structure defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
typedef struct confd_tag_value {
    struct xml_tag tag;
    confd_value_t v;
} confd_tag_value_t;
```

</div>

I.e. each value element is associated with the `struct xml_tag` that
identifies the node in the data model. The `ns` element of the
`struct xml_tag` can normally be set to 0, with the meaning "current
namespace". The array is populated, normally through a "depth first"
traversal of the data tree, as follows:

1.  Optional leafs or `presence` containers that do not exist are
    omitted entirely from the array.

2.  List and container nodes use one array element where the value has
    type C_XMLBEGIN, and `tag` and `ns` set according to the node name,
    followed by array elements for the sub-nodes according to this list,
    followed by one array element where the value has type C_XMLEND, and
    `tag` and `ns` set according to the node name.

3.  Leaf-list nodes use a single array element, with type C_LIST and the
    leaf-list elements as values.

4.  Leafs with a type other than `empty` use an array element with their
    type and value as usual. If type `empty` is placed in a `union`,
    then an array element is still used.

5.  Leafs of type `empty` use an array element with type C_XMLTAG, and
    `tag` and `ns` set according to the leaf name. Unless type `empty`
    is placed in a `union` as per above.

Note that the list or container node corresponding to the complete array
is not included in the array. In some usages, non-optional nodes may
also be omitted from the array - refer to the relevant API documentation
to see whether this is allowed and the semantics of doing so.

A set of CONFD_SET_TAG_XXX() macros corresponding to the CONFD_SET_XXX()
macros described above are provided - these set the `ns` element to 0
and the `tag` element to their second argument. The array corresponding
to the /servers/server{www} list entry above could be populated as:

<div class="informalexample">

    confd_tag_value_t tv[3];
    struct in_addr ip;

    CONFD_SET_TAG_STR(&tv[0], servers_name, "www");
    ip.s_addr = inet_addr("192.168.1.2");
    CONFD_SET_TAG_IPV4(&tv[1], servers_ip, ip);
    CONFD_SET_TAG_UINT16(&tv[2], servers_port, 80);

</div>

There are also macros to access the components of the
`confd_tag_value_t` elements:

<div class="informalexample">

    confd_tag_value_t tv;
    uint16_t port;

    if (CONFD_GET_TAG_TAG(&tv) == servers_port)
        port = CONFD_GET_UINT16(CONFD_GET_TAG_VALUE(&tv));

</div>

#### Tagged Value Attribute Array

This format uses an array of `confd_tag_value_attr_t` elements. This is
a structure defined as:

<div class="informalexample">

``` c
typedef struct confd_tag_value_attr {
    struct xml_tag tag;
    confd_value_t v;
    confd_attr_value_t *attrs;
    int num_attrs;
} confd_tag_value_attr_t;
```

</div>

I.e. the difference from Tagged Value Array is that not only the value
element is associated with the `struct xml_tag` but also the attribute
element. The `attrs` element should point to an array with `num_attrs`
elements of `confd_attr_value_t` - for a node without attributes, these
should be given as NULL and 0, respectively.

Attributes for a container are given for the C_XMLBEGIN array element
that indicates the start of the container, and attributes for a list
entry are given for the array element that represents the first key leaf
for the list (key leafs do not have attributes).

A set of CONFD_SET_TAG_ATTR_XXX() macros corresponding to the
CONFD_SET_TAG_XXX() macros described above are provided - these set the
`attrs` element to their forth argument and the `num_attrs` element to
their fifth argument. The array corresponding to the
/servers/server{www} list entry above could be populated as:

<div class="informalexample">

    confd_tag_value_attr_t tva[3];
    struct in_addr ip;
    confd_attr_value_t origin;

    origin.attr = CONFD_ATTR_ORIGIN;
    struct confd_identityref idref = {.ns = or__ns, .id = or_system};
    CONFD_SET_IDENTITYREF(&origin.v, idref);

    CONFD_SET_TAG_ATTR_STR(&tva[0], servers_name, "www", NULL, 0);
    ip.s_addr = inet_addr("192.168.1.2");
    CONFD_SET_TAG_ATTR_IPV4(&tva[1], servers_ip, ip, &origin, 1);
    CONFD_SET_TAG_ATTR_UINT16(&tva[2], servers_port, 80, &origin, 1);
            

</div>

### Data Model Types

This section describes the types that can be used in YANG data modeling,
and their C representation. Also listed is the corresponding SMIv2 type,
which is used when a data model is translated into a MIB. In several
cases, the data model type cannot easily be translated into a native
SMIv2 type. In those cases, the type `OCTET STRING` is used in the
translation. The SNMP agent in ConfD will in those cases send the string
representation of the value over SNMP. For example, the `xs:float` value
`3.14` is sent as the string "3.14".

These subsections describe the following sets of types, which can be
used with YANG data modeling:

- [YANG built-in
  types](section3.md#confd_types.data_model.yang_builtin_types)

- [The ietf-yang-types YANG
  module](section3.md#confd_types.data_model.ietf_yang_types)

- [The ietf-inet-types YANG
  module](section3.md#confd_types.data_model.ietf_inet_types)

- [The tailf-common YANG
  module](section3.md#confd_types.data_model.tailf_common)

- [The tailf-xsd-types YANG
  module](section3.md#confd_types.data_model.tailf_xsd_types)

##### The `leaf-list` statement

#### The iana-crypt-hash YANG module

This module defines a type for storing passwords using a hash function,
and features to indicate which hash functions are supported by an
implementation. The type is defined in the
<urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:iana-crypt-hash> namespace.

`ianach:crypt-hash`  
> The crypt-hash type is used to store passwords using a hash function.
> The algorithms for applying the hash function and encoding the result
> are implemented in various UNIX systems as the function crypt(3). A
> value of this type matches one of the forms:
>
> <div class="informalexample">
>
>     $0$<clear text password>
>     $<id>$<salt>$<password hash>
>     $<id>$<parameter>$<salt>$<password hash>
>
> </div>
>
> The "\$0\$" prefix indicates that the value is clear text. When such a
> value is received by the server, a hash value is calculated, and the
> string "\$\<id\>\$\<salt\>\$" or \$\<id\>\$\<parameter\>\$\<salt\>\$
> is prepended to the result. This value is stored in the configuration
> data store.
>
> If a value starting with "\$\<id\>\$", where \<id\> is not "0", is
> received, the server knows that the value already represents a hashed
> value, and stores it "as is" in the data store. Note that the "as is"
> behavior may cause confusion if a value that does not conform to the
> regular expression pattern is entered for the SHA-256 or SHA-512
> types. The expectation may be that value would be rejected as it would
> for values of other types, but special processing in the Tail-f
> implementation will accept the values as entered (i.e. "as-is") in
> order to conform to the RFC.
>
> In the Tail-f implementation, this type is logically a union of the
> types tailf:md5-digest-string, tailf:sha-256-digest-string, and
> tailf:sha-512-digest-string - see the section [The tailf-common YANG
> module](section3.md#confd_types.data_model.tailf_common) below. All the
> hashed values of these types are accepted, and the choice of algorithm
> to use for hashing clear text is specified via the
> /confdConfig/cryptHash/algorithm parameter in `confd.conf` (see
> [confd.conf(5)](section5.md#ncs.conf)). If the algorithm is set to
> "sha-256" or "sha-512", it can be tuned via the
> /confdConfig/cryptHash/rounds parameter in `confd.conf`.

#### The tailf-common YANG module

This module defines Tail-f common YANG types, that are built-in to
ConfD.

`tailf:size`  
> A value that represents a number of bytes. An example could be
> S1G8M7K956B; meaning 1GB+8MB+7KB+956B = 1082138556 bytes. The value
> must start with an S. Any byte magnifier can be left out, i.e. S1K1B
> equals 1025 bytes. The order is significant though, i.e. S1B56G is not
> a valid byte size.
>
> The value space and representation is identical to the built-in
> `uint64` type.

`tailf:octet-list`  
> A list of dot-separated octets for example "192.168.255.1.0".
>
> > [!NOTE]
> > The `tailf:value-length` restriction is measured in number of octets
> > for `octet-list`.
>
> - `value.type` = C_BINARY
>
> - union element = `buf`
>
> - C type = `confd_buf_t`
>
> - SMIv2 type = `OCTET STRING`

`tailf:hex-list`  
> A list of colon-separated hexa-decimal octets for example
> "4F:4C:41:71".
>
> > [!NOTE]
> > The `tailf:value-length` restriction is measured in octets of binary
> > data for `hex-list`.
>
> - `value.type` = C_BINARY
>
> - union element = `buf`
>
> - C type = `confd_buf_t`
>
> - SMIv2 type = `OCTET STRING`

`tailf:md5-digest-string`  
> The md5-digest-string type automatically computes a MD5 digest for a
> value adhering to this type.
>
> This is best explained using an example. Suppose we have a leaf:
>
> <div class="informalexample">
>
>     leaf key {
>       type tailf:md5-digest-string;
>     }
>
> </div>
>
> A valid configuration is:
>
> <div class="informalexample">
>
>     <key>$0$My plain text.</key>
>
> </div>
>
> The "\$0\$" prefix indicates that this is plain text and that this
> value should be represented as a MD5 digest from now. ConfD computes a
> MD5 digest for the value and prepends "\$1\$\<salt\>\$", where
> \<salt\> is a random eight character salt used to generate the digest.
> When this value later on is fetched from ConfD the following is
> returned:
>
> <div class="informalexample">
>
>     <key>$1$fB$ndk2z/PIS0S1SvzWLqTJb.</key>
>
> </div>
>
> A value adhering to md5-digest-string must have "\$0\$" or a
> "\$1\$\<salt\>\$" prefix.
>
> The digest algorithm is the same as the md5 crypt function used for
> encrypting passwords for various UNIX systems, e.g.
> <http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/src/lib/libcrypt/crypt.c?rev=1.5&content-type=text/plain>
>
> > [!NOTE]

>
> - C type = `confd_buf_t`
>
> - SMIv2 type = `OCTET STRING`

`tailf:sha-256-digest-string`  
> The sha-256-digest-string type automatically computes a SHA-256 digest
> for a value adhering to this type. A value of this type matches one of
