# 1. General
------------

  This document describes the nokia-sros_nc NED.

  IMPORTANT:
  This NED is delivered without any of the device YANG models bundled to the NED package.

  It is required to download the YANG files separately and rebuild the NED package before the NED is
  fully operational. See the README-rebuild.md for further information.

  In summary, the below steps are needed to have a fully functioning NED:

  ```
  1.  Compile the empty package and load it into NSO
  2a. Connect to device and fetch yang modules (if yang available on device or in git repository)
  2b. Copy vendor yang directly into src/yang (if yang is available elsewhere)
  3.  Verify yang, potentially fixing any issues
  4.  Re-Compile package (i.e. in NSO), and do packages reload
  ```

  ```


## 1.1 Extract the NED package
------------------------------

  It is assumed the NED package `ncs-<NSO version>-nokia-sros_nc-<NED version>.signed.bin` has already
  been downloaded from software.cisco.com.

  In this instruction the following example settings will be used:

  - NSO version: 6.0
  - NED version: 1.0.1
  - NED package downloaded to: /tmp/ned-package-store

  1. Extract the NED package and verify its signature:

      ```
      > cd /tmp/ned-package-store
      > chmod u+x ncs-6.0-nokia-sros_nc-1.0.1.signed.bin
      > ./ncs-6.0-nokia-sros_nc-1.0.1.signed.bin
      ```

  2. In case the signature can not be verified (for instance if no internet connection),
     do as below instead:

      ```
      > ./ncs-6.0-nokia-sros_nc-1.0.1.signed.bin --skip-verification
      ```

  3. The result of the extraction shall be a tar.gz file with the same name as the .bin file:

      ```
      > ls *.tar.gz
      ncs-6.0-nokia-sros_nc-1.0.1.tar.gz
      ```


## 1.2 Install the NED package
------------------------------

  There are two alternative ways to install this NED package.
  Which one to use depends on how NSO itself is setup.

  In the instructions below the following example settings will be used:

  - NSO version: 6.0
  - NED version: 1.0.1
  - NED download directory: /tmp/ned-package-store
  - NSO run time directory: ~/nso-lab-rundir

  A prerequisite is to set the environment variable NSO_RUNDIR to point at the NSO run time directory:

  ```
  > export NSO_RUNDIR=~/nso-lab-rundir
  ```

  **IMPORTANT**:

  This NED is delivered as an “empty” package, i.e without any device YANG models bundled.
  It must be rebuilt with the device YANG models to become operational.

  The procedure to rebuild the empty NED (described in the README-rebuild.md) shall typically
  be done in a lab environment. For this step a “local install” of the NED shall be used.
  It is not suitable to use “system install” here since it is intended for production systems only.

  Once this NED has been rebuilt with the device YANG and exported to one or many
  separate tar.gz customized NED packages, a “system installation” can be used on them.


### 1.2.1 Local install
-----------------------

  This section describes how to install a NED package on a locally installed NSO
  (see "NSO Local Install" in the NSO Installation guide).

  It is assumed the NED package has been been unpacked to a tar.gz file as described in 1.1.

  1. Untar the tar.gz file. This creates a new sub-directory named:
     `nokia-sros_nc-<NED major digit>.<NED minor digit>`:

     ```
     > tar xfz ncs-6.0-nokia-sros_nc-1.0.1.tar.gz
     > ls -d */
     nokia-sros_nc-gen-1.0
     ```

  2. Install the NED into NSO, using the ncs-setup tool:

     ```
     > ncs-setup --package nokia-sros_nc-gen-1.0 --dest $NSO_RUNDIR
     ```

  3. Open a NSO CLI session and load the new NED package like below:

     ```
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin
     admin@ncs# packages reload
     reload-result {
         package nokia-sros_nc-gen-1.0
         result true
     }
     ```

  Alternatively the tar.gz file can be installed directly into NSO. Then skip steps 1 and 2 and do like
  below instead:

  ```
    > ncs-setup --package ncs-6.0-nokia-sros_nc-1.0.1.tar.gz --dest $NSO_RUNDIR
    > ncs_cli -C -u admin
    admin@ncs# packages reload
    reload-result {
      package nokia-sros_nc-gen-1.0
      result true
   }
  ```

  Set the environment variable NED_ROOT_DIR to point at the NSO NED package:

  ```
  > export NED_ROOT_DIR=$NSO_RUNDIR/packages/nokia-sros_nc-gen-1.0
  ```


### 1.2.2 System install
------------------------

  This section describes how to install a NED package on a system installed NSO (see "NSO System
  Install" in the NSO Installation Guide).

  It is assumed the NED package has been been unpacked to a tar.gz file as described in 1.1.

  1. Do a NSO backup before installing the new NED package:

     ```
     > $NCS_DIR/bin/ncs-backup
     ```

  2. Start a NSO CLI session and fetch the NED package:

     ```
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin
     admin@ncs# software packages fetch package-from-file \
               /tmp/ned-package-store/ncs-6.0-nokia-sros_nc-1.0.tar.gz
     admin@ncs# software packages list
     package {
      name ncs-6.0-nokia-sros_nc-1.0.tar.gz
      installable
     }
     ```

  3. Install the NED package (add the argument replace-existing if a previous version has been loaded):

     ```
     admin@ncs# software packages install nokia-sros_nc-1.0
     admin@ncs# software packages list
     package {
      name ncs-6.0-nokia-sros_nc-1.0.tar.gz
      installed
     }
     ```

  4. Load the NED package

     ```
     admin@ncs# packages reload
     admin@ncs# software packages list
     package {
       name ncs-6.0-nokia-sros_nc-gen-1.0
       loaded
     }
     ```


## 1.3 Configure the NED in NSO
-------------------------------

  This section describes the steps for configuring a device instance
  using the newly installed NED package.

  - Start a NSO CLI session:

    ```
    > ncs_cli -C -u admin
    ```

  - Enter configuration mode:

    ```
    admin@ncs# configure
    Entering configuration mode terminal
    admin@ncs(config)#
    ```

  - Configure a new authentication group (my-group) to be used for this device:

    ```
    admin@ncs(config)# devices authgroup group my-group default-map remote-name <user name on device> \
                       remote-password <password on device>
    ```

  - Configure a new device instance (example: dev-1):

    ```
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 address <ip address to device>
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 port <port on device>
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 device-type generic ned-id nokia-sros_nc-gen-1.0
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 state admin-state unlocked
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 authgroup my-group
    ```
    **IMPORTANT**:

    The *device-type* shall always be set to *generic* when configuring a device instance
    to use a 3PY NED. A common mistake is configuring it as *netconf*, which will cause
    NSO to use its internal netconf client instead.

  - Finally commit the configuration

    ```
    admin@ncs(config)# commit
    ```

  - Verify configuration, using a sync-from.

    ```
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 sync-from
    result true
    ```

  If the sync-from was not successful, check the NED configuration again.


# 2. Optional debug and trace setup
-----------------------------------

  It is often desirable to see details from when and how the NED interacts with the device(Example: troubleshooting)

  This can be achieved by configuring NSO to generate a trace file for the NED. A trace file
  contains information about all interactions with the device. Messages sent and received as well
  as debug printouts, depending on the log level configured.

  NSO creates one separate trace file for each device instance with tracing enabled.
  Stored in the following location:

  `$NSO_RUNDIR/logs/ned-nokia-sros_nc-gen-1.0-<device name>.trace`

  Do as follows to enable tracing in one specific device instance in NSO:


  1. Start a NSO CLI session:

     ```
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin
     ```

  2. Enter configuration mode:

     ```
     admin@ncs# configure
     Entering configuration mode terminal
     admin@ncs(config)#
     ```

  3. Enable trace raw:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 trace raw
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

     Alternatively, tracing can be enabled globally affecting all configured device instances:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices global-settings trace raw
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  4. Configure the log level for printouts to the trace file:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 ned-settings nokia-sros_nc logger \
                       level [debug | verbose | info | error]
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

     Alternatively the log level can be set globally affecting all configured
     device instances using this NED package.

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device global-settings ned-settings nokia-sros_nc logger \
                       level [debug | verbose | info | error]
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  The log level 'info' is used by default and the 'debug' level is the most verbose.

  **IMPORTANT**:
  Tracing shall be used with caution. This feature does increase the number of IPC messages sent
  between the NED and NSO. In some cases this can affect the performance in NSO. Hence, tracing should
  normally be disabled in production systems.


  An alternative method for generating printouts from the NED is to enable the Java logging mechanism.
  This makes the NED print log messages to common NSO Java log file.

  `$NSO_RUNDIR/logs/ncs-java-vm.log`

  Do as follows to enable Java logging in the NED

  1. Start a NSO CLI session:

     ```
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin
     ```

  2. Enter configuration mode:

     ```
     admin@ncs# configure
     Entering configuration mode terminal
     admin@ncs(config)#
     ```

  3. Enable Java logging with level all from the NED package:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# java-vm java-logging logger com.tailf.packages.ned.sros \
                       level level-all
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  4. Configure the NED to log to the Java logger

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 ned-settings nokia-sros_nc logger java true
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

     Alternatively Java logging can be enabled globally affecting all configured
     device instances using this NED package.

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices global-settings ned-settings nokia-sros_nc logger java true
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  **IMPORTANT**:
  Java logging does not use any IPC messages sent to NSO. Consequently, NSO performance is not
  affected. However, all log printouts from all log enabled devices are saved in one single file.
  This means that the usability is limited. Typically single device use cases etc.

# 6. Built in live-status show
------------------------------

  The nokia-sroc_nc NED has full support for fetching operational data via the NSO live-status API.


# 7. Limitations
----------------

  The SROS device must be properly configured in model driven mode and with netconf enabled for this NED to function properly.
  Any other mode such as 'mixed mode' makes SROS limited and will prevent the NED from using certain features. For instance
  the fast transaction id calculation nethod which has been customized for SROS.

  Some issues has been observed when running towards SROS devices. These are briefly described here, please note that these
  are only what have been observed in specific use-cases, it might be related to device/SROS model/version, and also to specific
  configuration used in these use-cases. Hence, these issues might not be relevant for your use-case, and of course, there might
  be other issues which have not been observed.

  As has been observed with many vendors yang-models, SROS seems to contain some leafrefs that are not enforced in the
  device, which might lead to NSO reporting "illegal reference" when doing sync-from. See file src/customize-schema.schypp
  for these, i.e. paths which have an 'inline_type' operation in this file. Also see the README-rebuild.md for more info on
  mitigating "illegal reference".

  In some older versions of SROS, support for yang-library version 1.1 is announced, however, the implementation has bugs in it
  (this relates at least to SROS versions <= 20.10 which announce yang-library 1.1 support). In this case the NED needs to be
  configured to make it look like the device actually implements yang-library 1.0. This can be done by setting the
  below ned-settings:

  ```
      ned-settings nokia-sros_nc connection capabilities use-yang-library false
      ned-settings nokia-sros_nc connection capabilities regex-exclude .*yang-library:1.1.*
      ned-settings nokia-sros_nc connection capabilities inject urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:yang-library:1.0revision=2019-01-04&module-set-id=20.10.R4
  ```

  NOTE: The "fake" module-set-id used here is not relevant, it can be anything

  Another issue which has been observed is that while the device announces support for the yang-module ietf-interfaces, it
  can not be used for example inside the filter of a get-config request. Hence this module needs to be filtered out, which is
  done with the below ned-setting:

  ```
      ned-settings nokia-sros_nc transaction exclude-namespaces urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-interfaces
  ```

  At least SROS version 22 has problems with properly returning valid data from the openconfig data tree when the NED is doing
  a get-config request. The device seems to have problems with the default filter used by the NED. If the NED is built with
  openconfig, this filter will contain namespaces of the openconfig models. This will result in the device returning an error
  instead of the valid config.

  This issue can be solved by configuring the following NED setting:

  ```
      ned-settings nokia-sros_nc transaction get-config-no-filter true
  ```

  All current versions of SROS have a special non rfc compliant behaviour for settings related to the configuration groups 'bof' and 'li'.
  These configuration trees are regarded as separate datastores by SROS. This means SROS does not allow editing standard config together
  with 'bof' or 'li' settings in the same transaction. Furthermore editing 'bof' and 'li' settings does require Nokia specific non rfc
  compliant extensions to the netconf messages.

  Do as follows to enable support for managing 'bof' settings in the NED:

  1. Make sure the Nokia 'bof' models are included when rebuilding the NED.
     For example, use the profile 'sros-combined-with-bof-from-device' when downloading the models.

  2. Configure the following NED setting:
  ```
      ned-settings nokia-sros_nc transaction bof-settings enable true;
  ```

  3. Set the following NED setting to *true* for devices running SROS version 23 or newer. Default is *false*.
  ```
      ned-setinngs nokia-sros_nc transaction bof-settings use-config-region-ns true
  ```

  The NED does currently not support managing 'li' settings. This is something that can be added upon request.


# 8. How to report NED issues and feature requests
--------------------------------------------------

  **Issues like bugs and errors shall always be reported to the Cisco NSO NED team through
  the Cisco Support channel:**

  - <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html>
  - <https://developer.cisco.com/docs/nso/#!support/network-service-orchestrator-support>

  The following information is required for the Cisco NSO NED team to be able
  to investigate an issue:

    - A detailed recipe with steps to reproduce the issue.
    - A raw trace file generated when the issue is reproduced.
    - Access to a device where the issue can be reproduced by the Cisco NSO NED team.
      This typically means both read and write permissions are required.
      Pseudo access via tools like Webex, Zoom etc is not acceptable.
      However, it is ok with device access through VPNs, jump servers etc though.

  Do as follows to gather the necessary information needed for your device, here named 'dev-1':

  1. Enable full debug logging in the NED

     ```
     ncs_cli -C -u admin
     admin@ncs# configure
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 ned-settings nokia-sros_nc logging level debug
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  2. Configure the NSO to generate a raw trace file from the NED

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 trace raw
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  3. If the NED already had trace enabled, clear it in order to submit only relevant information

     Do as follows for NSO 6.4 or newer:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 clear-trace
     ```

     Do as follows for older NSO versions:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices clear-trace
     ```

  4. Run a compare-config to populate the trace with initial device config

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 compare-config
     ```

  5. Reproduce the found issue using ncs_cli or your NSO service.
     Write down each necessary step in a reproduction report.

  6. Gather the reproduction report and a copy of the raw trace file
     containing data recorded when the issue happened.

  7. Contact the Cisco support and request to open a case. Provide the gathered files
     together with access details for a device that can be used by the
     Cisco NSO NED when investigating the issue.


  **Requests for new features and extensions of the NED are handled by the Cisco NSO NED team when
  applicable. Such requests shall also go through the Cisco support channel.**

  The following information is required for feature requests and extensions:

  1. A detailed use case description, with details like:
     - Data of interest
     - The kind of operations to be used on the data. Like: 'read', 'create', 'update', 'delete'
       and the order of the operation
     - Device APIs involved in the operations (For example: REST URLs and payloads)
     - Device documentation describing the operations involved

  2. Run sync-from # devices device dev-1 sync-from (if relevant)

  3. Attach the raw trace to the ticket (if relevant)

  4. Access to a device that can be used by the Cisco NSO NED team for testing and verification
     of the new feature. This usually means that both read and write permissions are required.
     Pseudo access via tools like Webex, Zoom etc is not acceptable. However, it is ok with access
     through VPNs, jump servers etc.


# 9. How to rebuild a NED
--------------------------

  Check the README-rebuild.md file, chapter 1.3, for more information.


# 10. Configure the NED to use ssh multi factor authentication
---------------------------------------------------------------

  This NED supports multi factor authentication (MFA) using the ssh authentication
  method 'keyboard-interactive'.

  Some additional steps are required to enable the MFA support:

  1. Verify that your NSO version supports MFA. This is configurable as additional
     settings in the authentication group used by the device instance.

     Enter a NSO CLI and enter the following and do tab completion:

     ```
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin
     admin@ncs# show running-config devices authgroups group default default-map <tab>
     Possible completions:
     action-name                 The action to call when a notification is received.
     callback-node               Invoke a standalone action to retrieve login credentials for managed devices on the 'callback-node' instance.
     mfa                         Settings for handling multi-factor authentication towards the device
     public-key                  Use public-key authentication
     remote-name                 Specify device user name
     remote-password             Specify the remote password
     remote-secondary-password   Second password for configuration
     same-pass                   Use the local NCS password as the remote password
     same-secondary-password     Use the local NCS password as the remote secondary password
     same-user                   Use the local NCS user name as the remote user name
     ```

     If 'mfa' is displayed in the output like above, NSO has MFA support enabled.
     In case MFA is not supported it is necessary to upgrade NSO before proceeding.

  2. Implement the authenticator executable. The MFA feature relies on an external executable to take care of the client part
     of the multi factor authentication. The NED will automatically call this executable for each challenge presented by the
     ssh server and expects to get a proper response in return.

     The executable can be a simple shell script or a program implemented in any programming language.

     The required behaviour is like this:
      - read one line from stdin
        The line passed from the NED will be a semi colon separated string containing the following info:
        ```
        [<device name>;<user>;<password>;<opaque>;<ssh server name>;<ssh server instruction>;<ssh server prompt>;]
        ```
        The elements for device name, user, password and opaque corresponds to what has been configured in NSO.
        The ssh server name, instruction and prompt are given by the ssh server during the authentication step.

        Each individual element in the semi colon separated list is Base64 encoded.

      - Extract the challenge based on the contents above.

      - Print a response matching the challenge to stdout and exit with code 0

      - In case a matching response can not be given do exit with code 2

     Below is a simple example of an MFA authenticator implemented in Python3:

     ```
     #!/usr/bin/env python3
     import sys
     import base64

     # This is an example on how to implement an external multi factor authentication handler
     # that will be called by the NED upon a ssh 'keyboard-interactive' authentication
     # The handler is reading a line from stdin with the following expected format:
     #   [<device name>;<user>;<password>;<opaque>;<ssh server name>;<ssh server instruction>;<ssh server prompt>;]
     # All elements are base64 encoded.

     def decode(arg):
         return str(base64.b64decode(arg))[2:-1]

     if __name__ == '__main__':
         query_challenges = {
             "admin@localhost's password: ":'admin',
             'Enter SMS passcode:':'secretSMScode',
             'Press secret key: ':'2'
         }
         # read line from stdin and trim brackets
         line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()[1:-1]
         args = line.split(';')
         prompt = decode(args[6])
         if prompt in query_challenges.keys():
             print(query_challenges[prompt])
             exit(0)
         else:
             exit(2)
     ```

  3. Configure the authentication group used by the device instance to enable MFA. There
     are two configurables available:
     - executable    The path to the external multi factor authentication executable (mandatory).
     - opaque        Opaque data that will passed as a cookie element to the executable (optional).

     ```
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin
     admin@ncs# config
     Entering configuration mode terminal
     admin@ncs(config)# devices authgroups group <name> default-map mfa executable <path to the executable>
     admin@ncs(config)# devices authgroups group <name> default-map mfa opaque <some opaque data>
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  4. Try connecting to the device.


## 10.1 Trouble shooting
------------------------
  In case of connection problems the following steps can help for debugging:

  Enable the NED trace in debug level:

  ```
  > devices device dev-1 trace raw
  > devices device dev-1 ned-settings nokia-sros_nc logger level debug
  > commit
  ```

  Try connect again

  Inspect the generated trace file.

  Verify that the ssh client is using the external authenticator executable:

  ```
  using ssh external mfa executable: <configured path to executable>
  ```

  Verify that the executable is called with the challenges presented by the ssh server:

  ```
  calling external mfa executable with ssh server given name: '<name>', instruction: '<instruction>', prompt '<challenge>'
  ```

  Check for any errors reported by the NED when calling the executable

  ```
  ERROR: external mfa executable failed <....>
  ```

# 11. Run arbitrary commands on device
--------------------------------------

  Some commands that are available to a user logged in to an interactive CLI
  session on the device might not be available through NETCONF. For situations
  like this the NED provides the feature to run arbitrary commands on the device.

  The NED feature to execute commands is connected in NSO to a live-status action
  called 'exec any'.

  The NED does by default use the 'md-cli-raw-command' feature to tunnel commands
  to the device. This feature is supported by all newer versions of Nokia SROS.

  It is also possible to configure the NED to use an interactive SSH login to
  the device. This extra SSH session is then handled internally in the NED.
  This option works also with older versions of SROS.

  There are some ned-settings to control the behaviour of this feature, see the
  section 'ned-settings nokia-sros_nc live-status exec-any-mode and cli' in
  README-ned-settings.md for details on this.

  ```
  admin@ncs# devices device dev-1 live-status exec any admin display-config
  ```

  Note that when using ncs_cli, the command-line given might need to be quoted
  if it contains characters that are interpreted by the ncs_cli itself.
