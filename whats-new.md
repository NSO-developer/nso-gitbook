<summary><strong>Compliance Reporting</strong></summary>

The device, service, and template checks now run in parallel across the CPU cores in the system while utilizing less memory by streaming the report to disk instead of building the report in memory. Compliance templates can check devices for compliance. In addition, strict mode checks that the template configuration is the only configuration on the device. Reports can now be generated in `sqlite` format, which will produce an SQLite database file as the output of a report run.
