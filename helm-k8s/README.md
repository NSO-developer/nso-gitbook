# 1. General
------------

  This document describes the helm-k8s NED.

  The helm-k8s NED is used to target a host that manages helm (helm manager for the k8s cluster).
  Although the NED is generic as a NED type, the connection to the device is ssh-based. This means that the NED expects to connect over ssh to a host that is used as k8s manager using helm.

  The NED configuration is composed of two main parts:
      - charts part - this is a list containing the information for all onboarded charts on the targeted helm host
      - deployments part - this is a list containing charts deployment.

  When creating a deployment from a specific chart, the NED (and helm) will inherit the default values from the targeted chart. Chart values can be further customised in the NED configuration using the yang model (please check Configuration samples chapter for details).

  Note that chart creation or deletion is not allowed in the helm-k8s NED, as they are deemed out of the scope of the NED. Only deployments creation/deletion/updates is allowed.

  Before commiting changes (eg install deployments), it is possible to do a helm dry-run of the change, by running the following command from the NED:

  ```
  admin@ncs(config-config)# connect
  admin@ncs(config-config)# commit dry-run outformat native
  ```

  NOTE: since the dry-run needs to execute the helm dry-run on the target host, before using the above command, a connect needs to be executed before the dry-run command.

## 1.1 Extract the NED package
------------------------------

  It is assumed the NED package `ncs-<NSO version>-helm-k8s-<NED version>.signed.bin` has already
  been downloaded from software.cisco.com.

  In this instruction the following example settings will be used:

  - NSO version: 6.0
  - NED version: 1.0.1
  - NED package downloaded to: /tmp/ned-package-store

  1. Extract the NED package and verify its signature:

      ```
      > cd /tmp/ned-package-store
      > chmod u+x ncs-6.0-helm-k8s-1.0.1.signed.bin
      > ./ncs-6.0-helm-k8s-1.0.1.signed.bin
      ```

  2. In case the signature can not be verified (for instance if no internet connection),
     do as below instead:

      ```
      > ./ncs-6.0-helm-k8s-1.0.1.signed.bin --skip-verification
      ```

  3. The result of the extraction shall be a tar.gz file with the same name as the .bin file:

      ```
      > ls *.tar.gz
      ncs-6.0-helm-k8s-1.0.1.tar.gz
      ```


## 1.2 Install the NED package
------------------------------

  There are two alternative ways to install this NED package.
  Which one to use depends on how NSO itself is setup.

  In the instructions below the following example settings will be used:

  - NSO version: 6.0
  - NED version: 1.0.1
  - NED download directory: /tmp/ned-package-store
  - NSO run time directory: ~/nso-lab-rundir

  A prerequisite is to set the environment variable NSO_RUNDIR to point at the NSO run time directory:

  ```
  > export NSO_RUNDIR=~/nso-lab-rundir
  ```


### 1.2.1 Local install
-----------------------

  This section describes how to install a NED package on a locally installed NSO
  (see "NSO Local Install" in the NSO Installation guide).

  It is assumed the NED package has been been unpacked to a tar.gz file as described in 1.1.

  1. Untar the tar.gz file. This creates a new sub-directory named:
     `helm-k8s-<NED major digit>.<NED minor digit>`:

     ```
     > tar xfz ncs-6.0-helm-k8s-1.0.1.tar.gz
     > ls -d */
     helm-k8s-gen-1.0
     ```

  2. Install the NED into NSO, using the ncs-setup tool:

     ```
     > ncs-setup --package helm-k8s-gen-1.0 --dest $NSO_RUNDIR
     ```

  3. Open a NSO CLI session and load the new NED package like below:

     ```
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin
     admin@ncs# packages reload
     reload-result {
         package helm-k8s-gen-1.0
         result true
     }
     ```

  Alternatively the tar.gz file can be installed directly into NSO. Then skip steps 1 and 2 and do like
  below instead:

  ```
    > ncs-setup --package ncs-6.0-helm-k8s-1.0.1.tar.gz --dest $NSO_RUNDIR
    > ncs_cli -C -u admin
    admin@ncs# packages reload
    reload-result {
      package helm-k8s-gen-1.0
      result true
   }
  ```

  Set the environment variable NED_ROOT_DIR to point at the NSO NED package:

  ```
  > export NED_ROOT_DIR=$NSO_RUNDIR/packages/helm-k8s-gen-1.0
  ```


### 1.2.2 System install
------------------------

  This section describes how to install a NED package on a system installed NSO (see "NSO System
  Install" in the NSO Installation Guide).

  It is assumed the NED package has been been unpacked to a tar.gz file as described in 1.1.

  1. Do a NSO backup before installing the new NED package:

     ```
     > $NCS_DIR/bin/ncs-backup
     ```

  2. Start a NSO CLI session and fetch the NED package:

     ```
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin
     admin@ncs# software packages fetch package-from-file \
               /tmp/ned-package-store/ncs-6.0-helm-k8s-1.0.tar.gz
     admin@ncs# software packages list
     package {
      name ncs-6.0-helm-k8s-1.0.tar.gz
      installable
     }
     ```

  3. Install the NED package (add the argument replace-existing if a previous version has been loaded):

     ```
     admin@ncs# software packages install helm-k8s-1.0
     admin@ncs# software packages list
     package {
      name ncs-6.0-helm-k8s-1.0.tar.gz
      installed
     }
     ```

  4. Load the NED package

     ```
     admin@ncs# packages reload
     admin@ncs# software packages list
     package {
       name ncs-6.0-helm-k8s-gen-1.0
       loaded
     }
     ```


## 1.3 Configure the NED in NSO
-------------------------------

  This section describes the steps for configuring a device instance
  using the newly installed NED package.

  - Start a NSO CLI session:

    ```
    > ncs_cli -C -u admin
    ```

  - Enter configuration mode:

    ```
    admin@ncs# configure
    Entering configuration mode terminal
    admin@ncs(config)#
    ```

  - Configure a new authentication group (my-group) to be used for this device:

    ```
    admin@ncs(config)# devices authgroup group my-group default-map remote-name <user name on device> \
                       remote-password <password on device>
    ```

  - Configure a new device instance (example: dev-1):

    ```
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 address <ip address to device>
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 port <port on device>
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 device-type generic ned-id helm-k8s-gen-1.0
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 state admin-state unlocked
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 authgroup my-group
    ```
  - Finally commit the configuration

    ```
    admin@ncs(config)# commit
    ```

  - Verify configuration, using a sync-from.

    ```
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 sync-from
    result true
    ```

  If the sync-from was not successful, check the NED configuration again.


# 2. Optional debug and trace setup
-----------------------------------

  It is often desirable to see details from when and how the NED interacts with the device(Example: troubleshooting)

  This can be achieved by configuring NSO to generate a trace file for the NED. A trace file
  contains information about all interactions with the device. Messages sent and received as well
  as debug printouts, depending on the log level configured.

  NSO creates one separate trace file for each device instance with tracing enabled.
  Stored in the following location:

  `$NSO_RUNDIR/logs/ned-helm-k8s-gen-1.0-<device name>.trace`

  Do as follows to enable tracing in one specific device instance in NSO:


  1. Start a NSO CLI session:

     ```
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin
     ```

  2. Enter configuration mode:

     ```
     admin@ncs# configure
     Entering configuration mode terminal
     admin@ncs(config)#
     ```

  3. Enable trace raw:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 trace raw
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

     Alternatively, tracing can be enabled globally affecting all configured device instances:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices global-settings trace raw
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  4. Configure the log level for printouts to the trace file:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 ned-settings helm-k8s logger \
                       level [debug | verbose | info | error]
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

     Alternatively the log level can be set globally affecting all configured
     device instances using this NED package.

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device global-settings ned-settings helm-k8s logger \
                       level [debug | verbose | info | error]
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  The log level 'info' is used by default and the 'debug' level is the most verbose.

  **IMPORTANT**:
  Tracing shall be used with caution. This feature does increase the number of IPC messages sent
  between the NED and NSO. In some cases this can affect the performance in NSO. Hence, tracing should
  normally be disabled in production systems.


  An alternative method for generating printouts from the NED is to enable the Java logging mechanism.
  This makes the NED print log messages to common NSO Java log file.

  `$NSO_RUNDIR/logs/ncs-java-vm.log`

  Do as follows to enable Java logging in the NED

  1. Start a NSO CLI session:

     ```
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin
     ```

  2. Enter configuration mode:

     ```
     admin@ncs# configure
     Entering configuration mode terminal
     admin@ncs(config)#
     ```

  3. Enable Java logging with level all from the NED package:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# java-vm java-logging logger com.tailf.packages.ned.helm \
                       level level-all
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  4. Configure the NED to log to the Java logger

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 ned-settings helm-k8s logger java true
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

     Alternatively Java logging can be enabled globally affecting all configured
     device instances using this NED package.

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices global-settings ned-settings helm-k8s logger java true
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  **IMPORTANT**:
  Java logging does not use any IPC messages sent to NSO. Consequently, NSO performance is not
  affected. However, all log printouts from all log enabled devices are saved in one single file.
  This means that the usability is limited. Typically single device use cases etc.

# 3. Dependencies
-----------------

  This NED has the following host environment dependencies:

  - Java 1.8 (NSO version < 6.2)
  - Java 17 (NSO version >= 6.2)
  - Gnu Sed

  Dependencies for NED recompile:

   - Apache Ant
   - Bash
   - Gnu Sort
   - Gnu awk
   - Grep
   - Python3 (with packages: re, sys, getopt, subprocess, argparse, os, glob)


# 4. Sample device configuration
--------------------------------

  Bellow you can find a saple configuration to create a new deployment using helm-k8s NED:

  ```
  admin@ncs(config-config)# helm deployment test1
  admin@ncs(config-deployment-test1)#    chart-name    ned-charts/app2
  admin@ncs(config-deployment-test1)#    chart-version 0.1.0
  admin@ncs(config-deployment-test1)#    namespace     ned-apps
  admin@ncs(config-deployment-test1)#    app_version   0.0.1
  admin@ncs(config-deployment-test1)#    values key-value autoscaling.maxReplicas
  admin@ncs(config-key-value-autoscaling.maxReplicas)#     value 10
  admin@ncs(config-key-value-autoscaling.maxReplicas)#    exit
  admin@ncs(config-deployment-test1)# exit
  admin@ncs(config-config)#
  ```

  The new deployment named test1 will inherit the default values from the ned-charts/app2 chart and it will override the value of autoscaling.maxReplicas to 10


# 5. Built in live-status actions
---------------------------------

  All helm CLI commands can be executed using NED live-status RPC actions.
  An example of RPC call to list available repositories in helm is the following:

  ```
  admin@ncs(config-device-helm-1)# live-status exec helm repo list
  result
  NAME      	URL
  ned-charts	https://lpanduru.github.io/charts
  ```

  Note that using the live-status exec helm <command>, any helm command can be executed from the NED.


# 6. Built in live-status show
------------------------------

  The helm-k9s NED does not support live-status TTL-based data


# 7. Limitations
----------------

  Chart creation or deletion is not allowed in the helm-k8s NED, as they are deemed out of the scope of the NED.


# 8. How to report NED issues and feature requests
--------------------------------------------------

  **Issues like bugs and errors shall always be reported to the Cisco NSO NED team through
  the Cisco Support channel:**

  - <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html>
  - <https://developer.cisco.com/docs/nso/#!support/network-service-orchestrator-support>

  The following information is required for the Cisco NSO NED team to be able
  to investigate an issue:

    - A detailed recipe with steps to reproduce the issue.
    - A raw trace file generated when the issue is reproduced.
    - Access to a device where the issue can be reproduced by the Cisco NSO NED team.
      This typically means both read and write permissions are required.
      Pseudo access via tools like Webex, Zoom etc is not acceptable.
      However, it is ok with device access through VPNs, jump servers etc though.

  Do as follows to gather the necessary information needed for your device, here named 'dev-1':

  1. Enable full debug logging in the NED

     ```
     ncs_cli -C -u admin
     admin@ncs# configure
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 ned-settings helm-k8s logging level debug
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  2. Configure the NSO to generate a raw trace file from the NED

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 trace raw
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  3. If the NED already had trace enabled, clear it in order to submit only relevant information

     Do as follows for NSO 6.4 or newer:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 clear-trace
     ```

     Do as follows for older NSO versions:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices clear-trace
     ```

  4. Run a compare-config to populate the trace with initial device config

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 compare-config
     ```

  5. Reproduce the found issue using ncs_cli or your NSO service.
     Write down each necessary step in a reproduction report.

  6. Gather the reproduction report and a copy of the raw trace file
     containing data recorded when the issue happened.

  7. Contact the Cisco support and request to open a case. Provide the gathered files
     together with access details for a device that can be used by the
     Cisco NSO NED when investigating the issue.


  **Requests for new features and extensions of the NED are handled by the Cisco NSO NED team when
  applicable. Such requests shall also go through the Cisco support channel.**

  The following information is required for feature requests and extensions:

  1. A detailed use case description, with details like:
     - Data of interest
     - The kind of operations to be used on the data. Like: 'read', 'create', 'update', 'delete'
       and the order of the operation
     - Device APIs involved in the operations (For example: REST URLs and payloads)
     - Device documentation describing the operations involved

  2. Run sync-from # devices device dev-1 sync-from (if relevant)

  3. Attach the raw trace to the ticket (if relevant)

  4. Access to a device that can be used by the Cisco NSO NED team for testing and verification
     of the new feature. This usually means that both read and write permissions are required.
     Pseudo access via tools like Webex, Zoom etc is not acceptable. However, it is ok with access
     through VPNs, jump servers etc.


# 9. How to rebuild a NED
--------------------------

  To rebuild the NED do as follows:

  ```
  > cd $NED_ROOT_DIR/src
  > make clean all
  ```

  When the NED has been successfully rebuilt, it is necessary to reload the package into NSO.

  ```
  admin@ncs# packages reload
  ```
