**Mode of Install**

NSO System Install can be installed in **standard mode** or in [**FIPS**](https://www.nist.gov/itl/publications-0/federal-information-processing-standards-fips)**-compliant mode**. Standard mode install supports a broader set of cryptographic algorithms, while the FIPS mode install restricts NSO to use only FIPS 140-3-validated cryptographic modules and algorithms for enhanced/regulated security and compliance. Use FIPS mode only in environments that require compliance with specific security standards, especially in U.S. federal agencies or regulated industries. For all other use cases, install NSO in standard mode.

<sup>\* FIPS: Federal Information Processing Standards</sup>
{% endhint %}

### Step 1 - Fulfill System Requirements

Start by setting up your system to install and run NSO.

To install NSO:

1. Fulfill at least the primary requirements.
2. If you intend to build and run NSO deployment examples, you also need to install additional applications listed under Additional Requirements.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Where requirements list a specific or higher version, there always exists a (small) possibility that a higher version introduces breaking changes. If in doubt whether the higher version is fully backwards compatible, always use the specific version.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Primary Requirements</summary>

Primary requirements to do a System Install include:

* A system running Linux or macOS on either the `x86_64` or `ARM64` architecture for development. Linux for production. For [FIPS](https://www.nist.gov/itl/publications-0/federal-information-processing-standards-fips) mode, OS FIPS compliance may be required depending on your specific requirements.
* GNU libc 2.24 or higher.
* Java JRE 17 or higher. Used by Cisco Smart Licensing.
* Required and included with many Linux/macOS distributions:
  * `tar` command. Unpack the installer.
  * `gzip` command. Unpack the installer.
  * `ssh-keygen` command. Generate SSH host key.
  * `openssl` command. Generate self-signed certificates for HTTPS.
  * `find` command. Used to find out if all required libraries are available.
  * `which` command. Used by the NSO package manager.
  * `libpam.so.0`. Pluggable Authentication Module library.
  * `libexpat.so.1`. EXtensible Markup Language parsing library.
  * `libz.so.1` version 1.2.7.1 or higher. Data compression library.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Additional Requirements</summary>

Additional requirements to, for example, build and run NSO production deployment examples include:

* Java JDK 17 or higher.
* Ant 1.9.8 or higher.
* Python 3.10 or higher.
* Python Setuptools is required to build the Python API.
* Often installed using the Python package installer pip:
  * Python Paramiko 2.2 or higher. To use netconf-console.
  * Python requests. Used by the RESTCONF demo scripts.
* `xsltproc` command. Used by the `support/ned-make-package-meta-data` command to generate the `package-meta-data.xml` file.
* One of the following web browsers is required for NSO GUI capabilities. The version must be supported by the vendor at the time of release.
  * Safari
  * Mozilla Firefox
  * Microsoft Edge
  * Google Chrome
* OpenSSH client applications. For example, `ssh` and `scp` commands.
* cron. Run time-based tasks, such as `logrotate`.
* `logrotate`. rotate, compress, and mail NSO and system logs.
* `rsyslog`. pass NSO logs to a local syslog managed by `rsyslogd` and pass logs to a remote node.
* `systemd` or `init.d` scripts to start and stop NSO.

</details>

<details>

<summary>FIPS Mode Entropy Requirements</summary>

The following applies if you are running a container-based setup of your FIPS install:

In containerized environments (e.g., Docker) that run on older Linux kernels (e.g., Ubuntu 18.04), `/dev/random` may block if the systemâ€™s entropy pool is low. This can lead to delays or hangs in FIPS mode, as cryptographic operations require high-quality randomness.

To avoid this:

* Prefer newer kernels (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04 or later), where entropy handling is improved to mitigate the issue.
* Or, install an entropy daemon like Haveged on the Docker host to help maintain sufficient entropy.

Check available entropy on the host system with:

```bash
cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
```

A value of 256 or higher is generally considered safe. Reference: [Oracle blog post](https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/post/entropyavail-256-is-good-enough-for-everyone).

</details>

### Step 2 - Download the Installer and NEDs <a href="#si.download.the.installer" id="si.download.the.installer"></a>

To download the Cisco NSO installer and example NEDs:

1. Go to the Cisco's official [Software Download](https://software.cisco.com/download/home) site.
2. Search for the product "Network Services Orchestrator" and select the desired version.
3. There are two versions of the NSO installer, i.e. for macOS and Linux systems. For System Install, choose the Linux OS version.

<details>

<summary>Identifying the Installer</summary>

You need to know your system specifications (Operating System and CPU architecture) to choose the appropriate NSO installer.

NSO is delivered as an OS/CPU-specific signed self-extractable archive. The signed archive file has the pattern `nso-VERSION.OS.ARCH.signed.bin` that after signature verification extracts the `nso-VERSION.OS.ARCH.installer.bin` archive file, where:

* `VERSION` is the NSO version to install.
* `OS` is the Operating System (`linux` for all Linux distributions and `darwin` for macOS).
* `ARCH` is the CPU architecture, for example`x86_64`.

</details>

### Step 3 - Unpack the Installer <a href="#si.unpack.the.installer" id="si.unpack.the.installer"></a>

If your downloaded file is a `signed.bin` file, it means that it has been digitally signed by Cisco, and upon execution, you will verify the signature and unpack the `installer.bin`.

If you only have `installer.bin`, skip to the next step.

To unpack the installer:

1.  In the terminal, list the binaries in the directory where you downloaded the installer, for example:

    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads
    ls -l nso*.bin
    -rw-r--r--@ 1 user  staff   199M Dec 15 11:45 nso-6.0.linux.x86_64.installer.bin
    -rw-r--r--@ 1 user  staff   199M Dec 15 11:45 nso-6.0.linux.x86_64.signed.bin
    ```
2.  Use the `sh` command to run the `signed.bin` to verify the certificate and extract the installer binary and other files. An example output is shown below.

    ```bash
    sh nso-6.0.linux.x86_64.signed.bin
    # Output
    Unpacking...
    Verifying signature...
    Downloading CA certificate from http://www.cisco.com/security/pki/certs/crcam2.cer ...
    Successfully downloaded and verified crcam2.cer.
    Downloading SubCA certificate from http://www.cisco.com/security/pki/certs/innerspace.cer ...
    Successfully downloaded and verified innerspace.cer.
    Successfully verified root, subca and end-entity certificate chain.
    Successfully fetched a public key from tailf.cer.
    Successfully verified the signature of nso-6.0.linux.x86_64.installer.bin using tailf.cer
    ```
3.  List the files to check if extraction was successful.

    ```bash
    ls -l
    # Output
    -rw-r--r--  1 user  staff   1.8K Nov 29 06:05 README.signature
    -rw-r--r--  1 user  staff    12K Nov 29 06:05 cisco_x509_verify_release.py
    -rwxr-xr-x  1 user  staff   199M Nov 29 05:55 nso-6.0.linux.x86_64.installer.bin
    -rw-r--r--  1 user  staff   256B Nov 29 06:05 nso-6.0.linux.x86_64.installer.bin.signature
    -rwxr-xr-x@ 1 user  staff   199M Dec 15 11:45 nso-6.0.linux.x86_64.signed.bin
    -rw-r--r--  1 user  staff   1.4K Nov 29 06:05 tailf.cer
    ```

{% hint style="info" %}
There may also be additional files present.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Description of Unpacked Files</summary>

The following contents are unpacked:

* `nso-VERSION.OS.ARCH.installer.bin`: The NSO installer.
* `nso-VERSION.OS.ARCH.installer.bin.signature`: Signature generated for the NSO image.
* `tailf.cer`: An enclosed Cisco-signed x.509 end-entity certificate containing the public key that is used to verify the signature.
* `README.signature`: File with further details on the unpacked content and steps on how to run the signature verification program. To manually verify the signature, refer to the steps in this file.
* `cisco_x509_verify_release.py`: Python program that can be used to verify the 3-tier x.509 certificate chain and signature.
* Multiple `.tar.gz` files: Bundled packages, extending the base NSO functionality.
* Multiple `.tar.gz.signature` files: Digital signatures for the bundled packages.

Since NSO version 6.3, a few additional NSO packages are included. They contain the following platform tools:

* HCC
* Observability Exporter
* Phased Provisioning
* Resource Manager

For platform tools documentation, refer to the individual package's `README` file or to the [online documentation](https://nso-docs.cisco.com/resources).

**NED Packages**

The NED packages that are available with the NSO installation are netsim-based example NEDs. These NEDs are used for NSO examples only.

Fetch the latest production-grade NEDs from [Cisco Software Download](https://software.cisco.com/download/home) using the URLs provided on your NED license certificates.

**Manual Pages**

The installation program will unpack the NSO manual pages from the documentation archive, allowing you to use the `man` command to view them. The Manual Pages are also available in PDF format and from the online documentation located on [NCS man-pages, Volume 1](../../resources/man/ncs-installer.1.md) in Manual Pages.

Following is a list of a few of the installed manual pages:

* `ncs(1)`: Command to start and control the NSO daemon.
* `ncsc(1)`: NSO Yang compiler.
* `ncs_cli(1)`: Frontend to the NSO CLI engine.
* `ncs-netsim(1)`: Command to create and manipulate a simulated network.
* `ncs-setup(1)`: Command to create an initial NSO setup.
* `ncs.conf`: NSO daemon configuration file format.

For example, to view the manual page describing the NSO configuration file, you should type:

```bash
$ man ncs.conf
```

Apart from the manual pages, extensive information about command line options can be obtained by running `ncs` and `ncsc` with the `--help` (abbreviated `-h`) flag.

```bash
$ ncs --help
```

```bash
$ ncsc --help
```

**Installer Help**

Run the `sh nso-VERSION.linux.x86_64.installer.bin --help` command to view additional help on running binaries. More details can be found in the [ncs-installer(1)](../../resources/man/ncs-installer.1.md) Manual Page included with NSO.

Notice the two options for `--local-install` or `--system-install`.

```bash
sh nso-6.0.linux.x86_64.installer.bin --help
```

</details>

### Step 4 - Run the Installer <a href="#si.run.the.installer" id="si.run.the.installer"></a>

To run the installer:

1. Navigate to your Install Directory.
2. Run the installer with the `--system-install` option to perform System Install. This option creates an install of NSO that is suitable for production deployment. At this point, you can choose to install NSO in standard mode or in FIPS mode.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Standard System Install" %}
The standard mode is the regular NSO install and is suitable for most installations. FIPS is disabled in this mode.

For standard NSO install, run the installer as below.

```bash
$ sudo sh nso-VERSION.OS.ARCH.installer.bin --system-install
```

{% code title="Example: Standard System Install" %}
```bash
$ sudo sh nso-6.0.linux.x86_64.installer.bin --system-install
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="FIPS System Install" %}
FIPS mode creates a FIPS-compliant NSO install.

FIPS mode should only be used for deployments that are subject to strict compliance regulations as the cryptographic functions are then confined to the CiscoSSL FIPS 140-3 module library.

For FIPS-compliant NSO install, run the command with the additional `--fips-install` flag. Afterwards, verify FIPS in `ncs.conf`.

```bash
$ sudo sh nso-VERSION.OS.ARCH.installer.bin --system-install --fips-install
```

{% code title="Example: FIPS System Install" %}
```bash
$ sudo sh nso-6.5.linux.x86_64.installer.bin --system-install --fips-install
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**NSO Configuration for FIPS**

Note the following as part of FIPS-specific configuration/install:

1. The `ncs.conf` file is automatically configured to enable FIPS by setting the following flag:

```xml
<fips-mode>
    <enabled>true</enabled>
</fips-mode>
```

2. Additional environment variables (`NCS_OPENSSL_CONF_INCLUDE`, `NCS_OPENSSL_CONF`, `NCS_OPENSSL_MODULES`) are configured in `ncsrc` for FIPS compliance.
3. The default `crypto.so` is overwritten at install for FIPS compliance.

Additionally, note that:

* As certain algorithms typically available with CiscoSSL are not included in the FIPS 140-3 validated module (and therefore disabled in FIPS mode), you need to configure NSO to use only the algorithms and cryptographic suites available through the CiscoSSL FIPS 140-3 object module.
* With FIPS, NSO signals the NEDs to operate in FIPS mode using Bouncy Castle FIPS libraries for Java-based components, ensuring compliance with FIPS 140-3. To support this, NED packages may also require upgrading, as older versions â€” particularly SSH-based NEDs â€” often lack the necessary FIPS signaling or Bouncy Castle support required for cryptographic compliance.
* Configure SSH keys in `ncs.conf` and `init.xml`.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

<details>

<summary>Default Directories and Scripts</summary>

The System Install by default creates the following directories:

* The Installation Directory is created in `/opt/ncs`, where the distribution is available.
* The Configuration Directory is created in `/etc/ncs`, where the `ncs.conf` file, SSH keys, and WebUI certificates are created.
* The Running Directory is created in `/var/opt/ncs`, where runtime state files, CDB database, and packages are created.
* The Log Directory is created in `/var/log/ncs`, where the log files are populated.
* System-wide environment variables are created in `/etc/profile.d/ncs.sh`.
* The installer creates a `systemd` system service script in `/etc/systemd/system/ncs.service` and enables the NSO service to start at boot, but the service is _not_ started immediately. See the steps below for starting NSO after installation and before rebooting.
* To allow package reload when starting NSO, an environment file called `/etc/ncs/ncs.systemd.conf` is created. This file is owned by the user that starts NSO.

For the `--system-install` option, you can also choose a user-defined (non-default) Installation Directory, Configuration Directory, Running Directory, and Log Directory with `--install-dir`, `--config-dir`, `--run-dir` and `--log-dir` parameters, and specify that NSO should run as a different user than root with the `--run-as-user` parameter.

If you choose a non-default Installation Directory by using `--install-dir`, you need to specify `--install-dir` for subsequent installs and also for backup and restore.

Use the `--ignore-init-scripts` option to disable provisioning the `systemd` system service.

If a legacy SysV service exists in `/etc/init.d/ncs` when installing in interactive mode, the user will be prompted to continue using the old SysV service behavior or prepare a `systemd` service. In non-interactive mode, a `systemd` service will be prepared where a `/etc/systemd/system/ncs.service.prepare` file is created. The service is not enabled to start at boot. To enable it, rename it to `/etc/systemd/system/ncs.service` and remove the old `/etc/init.d/ncs` SysV service. When using the `--non-interactive` option, the `/etc/systemd/system/ncs.service` file will be overwritten if it already exists.

For more information on the `ncs-installer`, see the [ncs-installer(1)](../../resources/man/ncs-installer.1.md) man page.

<summary>Enable Strict Overcommit Accounting on the Host.</summary>

By default, the Linux kernel allows overcommit of memory. However, memory overcommit produces an unexpected and unreliable environment for NSO because the Linux Out-Of-Memory (OOM) killer may terminate NSO without restarting it if the system is critically low on memory. Also, when the OOM killer terminates NSO, no system dump file will be produced, and the debug information will be lost. Thus, it is strongly recommended to enable strict overcommit accounting.

#### **Heuristic Overcommit Mode as an Alternative to Strict Overcommit**

The alternativeâ€”using heuristic overcommit mode (see below for bestâ€‘effort recommendations)â€”can be useful if the NSO host has severe memory limitations. For example, if RAM sizing for the NSO host did not take into account that the schema (from YANG models) is loaded into memory by NSO Python and Java packages affecting total committed memory (Committed\_AS) and after considering the recommendations in [CDB Stores the YANG Model Schema](../../development/advanced-development/scaling-and-performance-optimization.md#d5e8743).

#### Recommended: Host Configured for Strict Overcommit

* Set `vm.overcommit_memory=2` to enable strict overcommit accounting.
* Set `vm.overcommit_ratio` so the CommitLimit is approximately equal to physical RAM, with a 5% headroom for the kernel to reduce the risk of system-wide OOM conditions. E.g., 95% of RAM when no swap is present (recommended), or subtract 5 percentage points from the calculated ratio that neutralizes swap. Increase the headroom if the host runs additional services.
* Alternatively, set `vm.overcommit_kbytes` which takes precedence; `vm.overcommit_ratio` is ignored while `vm.overcommit_kbytes > 0`.&#x20;
  * When vm.overcommit\_kbytes > 0, it sets a fixed CommitLimit in kB and ignores ratio and swap in the calculation. Note that HugeTLB is not subtracted when overcommit\_kbytes is used (itâ€™s a fixed value).
* Strongly discourage swap use at runtime by setting `vm.swappiness=1`.
* If swap must remain enabled system-wide, prevent NSO from using swap by configuring its cgroup with `memory.swap.max=0` (cgroup v2).
* If swap must be enabled for NSO use a fast disk, for example, an NVMe SSD.

**Apply Immediately**

{% code title="To apply strict overcommit accounting with immediate effect" %}
```bash
echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
```
{% endcode %}

When `vm.overcommit_memory=2`, the overcommit\_ratio parameter defines the percentage of physical RAM that is available for commit.

The Linux kernel computes the CommitLimit:

CommitLimit = MemTotal Ã— (overcommit\_ratio / 100) + SwapTotal âˆ’ total\_huge\_TLB

* MemTotal is the total amount of RAM on the system.
* overcommit\_ratio is the value in `/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio` .
* SwapTotal is the amount of swap space. Can be 0.
* total\_huge\_TLB is the amount of memory set aside for huge pages. Can be 0.

The default overcommit\_ratio is 50%. On systems with more than 50% of RAM available, this default can underutilize physical memory.

Do not set `vm.overcommit_ratio=100` as it includes all RAM plus all swap in the CommitLimit and leaves no headroom for the kernel. While swap increases the commit capacity, it is usually slow and should be avoided for NSO.

**Compute overcommit\_ratio to Neutralize Swap**

To allocate physical RAM only in commit accounting and keep a 5-10% headroom for the kernel:

* Compute the base ratio: base\_ratio = 100 Ã— (MemTotal âˆ’ SwapTotal) / MemTotal.
* Apply headroom: overcommit\_ratio = floor(base\_ratio) âˆ’ 5.

Notes:

* overcommit\_ratio is an integer; round down for a bit of extra headroom.
* Recompute the ratio if RAM or swap changes.
* If SwapTotal â‰¥ MemTotal, swap cannot be neutralized via overcommit\_ratio, use overcommit\_kbytes; see Example 3.
* If the computed value is very low, ensure it still fits your workload requirements.

**Example 1: No Swap, 5% Headroom**

{% code title="Check memory totals" %}
```bash
cat /proc/meminfo | grep "MemTotal\|SwapTotal"
MemTotal:    8039352 kB
SwapTotal:         0 kB
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="Apply settings with immediate effect" %}
```bash
echo 2  > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
echo 95 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio
echo 1  > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
```
{% endcode %}

Rationale: With no swap, set overcommit\_ratio=95 to allow \~95% of RAM for user-space commit, leaving \~5% headroom for the kernel.

**Example 2: MemTotal > SwapTotal, Neutralize Swap with 5% Headroom**

{% code title="Check memory totals" %}
```bash
cat /proc/meminfo | grep "MemTotal\|SwapTotal"
MemTotal:    8039352 kB
SwapTotal:   1048572 kB
```
{% endcode %}

Calculate the ratio:

* base\_ratio= 100 Ã— ((8039352 âˆ’ 1048572) / 8039352) â‰ˆ 86.9%.
* Apply 5% headroom: overcommit\_ratio = floor(86.9) âˆ’ 5 = 81.

{% code title="Apply" %}
```bash
echo 2  > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
echo 81 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_ratio
echo 1  > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
```
{% endcode %}

This keeps the CommitLimit safely below physical RAM to provide kernel headroom and neutralizes swapâ€™s contribution to CommitLimit and then applies 5% headroom toward the commit budget.

**Example 3: SwapTotal â‰¥ MemTotal (Headroom via ratio not applicable, use overcommit\_kbytes)**

{% code title="Check memory totals" %}
```bash
cat /proc/meminfo | grep "MemTotal\|SwapTotal"
MemTotal:    16000000 kB
SwapTotal:   16000000 kB
```
{% endcode %}

Compute:

* CommitLimit\_kB = floor(MemTotal Ã— 0.95) = floor(16,000,000 Ã— 0.95) = 15,200,000 kB.

{% code title="Apply" %}
```bash
echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory
echo 15200000 > /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_kbytes
echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
```
{% endcode %}

Note that overcommit\_kbytes sets a fixed CommitLimit that ignores swap; recompute if RAM changes. Also note the HugeTLB subtraction does not apply when using overcommit\_kbytes (fixed commit budget).

Refer to the Linux [proc\_sys\_vm(5)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc_sys_vm.5.html) manual page for more details on the overcommit\_memory, overcommit\_ratio, and overcommit\_kbytes parameters.

**Persist Across Reboots**

To ensure the overcommit remains disabled after reboot, add the three lines below to `/etc/sysctl.conf` (or a file under `/etc/sysctl.d/`).

{% code title="Add to /etc/sysctl.conf" %}
```
vm.overcommit_memory = 2
vm.overcommit_ratio = <integer> # if not using overcommit_kbytes
vm.overcommit_kbytes = <kbytes> # if using a fixed CommitLimit
vm.swappiness = 1
```
{% endcode %}

See the Linux [sysctl.conf(5)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/sysctl.conf.5.html) manual page for details.

**NSO Crash Dumps**

If NSO aborts due to failure to allocate memory, NSO will produce a system dump by default before aborting. When starting NSO from a non-root user, set the `NCS_DUMP` environment variable to point to a filename in a directory that the non-root user can access. The default setting is `NCS_DUMP=ncs_crash.dump`, where the file is written to the NSO run-time directory, typically `NCS_RUN_DIR=/var/opt/ncs`. If the user running NSO cannot write to the directory that the `NCS_DUMP` environment variable points to, generating the system dump file will fail, and the debug information will be lost.

#### **Alternative: Heuristic Overcommit Mode (vm.overcommit\_memory=0) With Committed\_AS Monitoring**

As an alternative to the recommended strict mode, `vm.overcommit_memory=2`, you can keep `vm.overcommit_memory=0` to allow overcommit of memory and monitor the total committed memory (Committed\_AS) versus CommitLimit using, for example, a best effort script or observability tool. When Committed\_AS crosses a threshold, for example, 90% of CommitLimit, proactively trigger a series of NSO debug dumps every few seconds via `ncs --debug-dump`. Optionally, a second critical threshold, for example, 95% of CommitLimit, proactively trigger NSO to produce a system dump and then exit gracefully.

* This approach does not prevent NSO from getting killed; it attempts to capture diagnostic data before memory pressure becomes critical and the Linux OOM-killer kills NSO.
* If swap is enabled, prefer vm.swappiness=1 and consider placing NSO in a cgroup with memory.swap.max=0 to avoid swap I/O for NSO. Requires Linux cgroup v2 and a service-managed cgroup (e.g., systemd) support.

- Committed\_AS versus CommitLimit is a more meaningful earlyâ€‘warning signal than Committed\_AS versus MemTotal, because CommitLimit reflects the kernelâ€™s current overcommit policy, swap availability, and huge page reservationsâ€”MemTotal does not.
- When in Heuristic mode (vm.overcommit\_memory=0): CommitLimit is informative, not enforced. Itâ€™s still better than MemTotal for early warning, but OOM can occur before or after you reach it.
- If necessary for your use-case, complement with MemAvailable, swap activity (vmstat or /proc/vmstat), PSI memory pressure (/proc/pressure/memory), and perâ€‘process/cgroup RSS to catch imminent pressure that Committed\_AS alone may miss.
- Ensure the user running the monitor has permission to execute `ncs --debug-dump` and write to the chosen dump directory.
- See "NSO Crash Dumps" above for crash dump details.

{% hint style="info" %}
Some older NSO releases expect the `/etc/init.d/` folder to exist in the host operating system. If the folder does not exist, the installer may fail to successfully install NSO. A workaround that allows the installer to proceed is to create the folder manually, but the NSO process will not automatically start at boot.
{% endhint %}

### Step 5 - Set Up User Access <a href="#si.setup.user.access" id="si.setup.user.access"></a>

The installation is configured for PAM authentication, with group assignment based on the OS group database (e.g. `/etc/group` file). Users that need access to NSO must belong to either the `ncsadmin` group (for unlimited access rights) or the `ncsoper` group (for minimal access rights).

To set up user access:

1.  To create the `ncsadmin` group, use the OS shell command:

    ```bash
    # groupadd ncsadmin
    ```
2.  To create the `ncsoper` group, use the OS shell command:

    ```bash
    # groupadd ncsoper
    ```
3.  To add an existing user to one of these groups, use the OS shell command:

    ```bash
    # usermod -a -G 'groupname' 'username'
    ```

### Step 6 - Set Environment Variables <a href="#si.set.env.variables" id="si.set.env.variables"></a>

To set environment variables:

1.  Change to Super User privileges.

    ```bash
    $ sudo -s
    ```
2.  The installation program creates a shell script file in each NSO installation which sets the environment variables needed to run NSO. With the `--system-install` option, by default, these settings are set on the shell. To explicitly set the variables, source `ncs.sh` or `ncs.csh` depending on your shell type.

    ```bash
    # source /etc/profile.d/ncs.sh
    ```
3.  Start NSO.

    ```bash
    # systemctl daemon-reload
    # systemctl start ncs
    ```

    NSO starts at boot going forward.

    Once you log on with the user that belongs to `ncsadmin` or `ncsoper`, you can directly access the CLI as shown below:

    ```bash
    $ ncs_cli -C
    ```

### Step 7 - Runtime Directory Creation <a href="#si.runtime.directory.creation" id="si.runtime.directory.creation"></a>

As part of the System Install, the NSO daemon `ncs` is automatically started at boot time. You do not need to create a Runtime Directory for System Install.

### Step 8 - Generate License Registration Token <a href="#si.generate.license.token" id="si.generate.license.token"></a>

To conclude the NSO installation, a license registration token must be created using a (CSSM) account. This is because NSO uses [Cisco Smart Licensing](../management/system-management/cisco-smart-licensing.md) to make it easy to deploy and manage NSO license entitlements. Login credentials to the [Cisco Smart Software Manager](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/buy/smart-accounts/software-manager.html) (CSSM) account are provided by your Cisco contact and detailed instructions on how to [create a registration token](../management/system-management/cisco-smart-licensing.md#d5e2927) can be found in the Cisco Smart Licensing. General licensing information covering licensing models, how licensing works, usage compliance, etc., is covered in the [Cisco Software Licensing Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/buy/licensing/licensing-guide.html).

To generate a license registration token:

1.  When you have a token, start a Cisco CLI towards NSO and enter the token, for example:

    ```bash
    $ ncs_cli -Cu admin
    admin@ncs# license smart register idtoken
    YzIzMDM3MTgtZTRkNC00YjkxLTk2ODQtOGEzMTM3OTg5MG

    Registration process in progress.
    Use the 'show license status' command to check the progress and result.
    ```

    \
    Upon successful registration, NSO automatically requests a license entitlement for its own instance and for the number of devices it orchestrates and their NED types. If development mode has been enabled, only development entitlement for the NSO instance itself is requested.
2.  Inspect the requested entitlements using the command `show license all` (or by inspecting the NSO daemon log). An example output is shown below.

    ```bash
    admin@ncs# show license all
    ...

<summary>Evaluation Period</summary>

If no registration token is provided, NSO enters a 90-day evaluation period and the remaining evaluation time is recorded hourly in the NSO daemon log:

```
      ...

<summary>Communication Send Error</summary>

During upgrades, if you experience a 'Communication Send Error' during license registration, restart the Smart Agent.

</details>

<details>

<summary>If You are Unable to Access Cisco Smart Software Manager</summary>

In a situation where the NSO instance has no direct access to the Cisco Smart Software Manager, one option is the [Cisco Smart Software Manager Satellite](https://software.cisco.com/software/csws/ws/platform/home) which can be installed to manage software licenses on the premises. Install the satellite and use the command `call-home destination address http <url:port>` to point to the satellite.

Another option when direct access is not desired is to configure an HTTP or HTTPS proxy, e.g., `smart-license smart-agent proxy url https://127.0.0.1:8080`. If you plan to do this, take the note below regarding ignored CLI configurations into account:

If `ncs.conf` contains a configuration for any of the java-executable, java-options, override-url/url, or proxy/url under the configure path `/ncs-config/smart-license/smart-agent/`, then any corresponding configuration done via the CLI is ignored.

<summary>License Registration in HA Mode</summary>

When configuring NSO in High Availability (HA) mode, the license registration token must be provided to the CLI running on the primary node. Read more about HA and node types in [High Availability](../management/high-availability.md)_._

</details>

<details>

<summary>Licensing Log</summary>

Licensing activities are also logged in the NSO daemon log as described in [Monitoring NSO](../management/system-management/#d5e7876). For example, a successful token registration results in the following log entry:

```
<INFO> 21-Apr-2016::11:29:18.022 miosaterm confd[8226]:
Smart Licensing Global Notification:
type = "notifyRegisterSuccess"
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Check Registration Status</summary>

To check the registration status, use the command `show license status`.

```bash
admin@ncs# show license status
