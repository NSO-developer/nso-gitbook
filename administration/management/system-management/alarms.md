## Alarm type descriptions

<details>

<summary><code>abort-error</code></summary>

* **Initial Perceived Severity**  
  major
* **Description**  
  An error happened while aborting or reverting a transaction. Device's
configuration is likely to be inconsistent with the NCS CDB.
* **Recommended Action**  
  Inspect the configuration difference with compare-config,
  resolve conflicts with sync-from or sync-to if any.
* **Clear condition(s)**  
  If NCS achieves sync with the device, or receives a transaction
  id for a netconf session towards the device, the alarm is cleared.
* **Alarm message(s):**  
  * `Device {dev} is locked`
  * `Device {dev} is southbound locked`
  * `abort error`

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>alarm-type</code></summary>

* **Description**  
  Base identity for alarm types.  A unique identification of the
fault, not including the managed object.  Alarm types are used
to identify if alarms indicate the same problem or not, for
lookup into external alarm documentation, etc.  Different
managed object types and instances can share alarm types.  If
the same managed object reports the same alarm type, it is to
be considered to be the same alarm.  The alarm type is a
simplification of the different X.733 and 3GPP alarm IRP alarm
correlation mechanisms and it allows for hierarchical
extensions.  
A 'specific-problem' can be used in addition to the alarm type
in order to have different alarm types based on information not
known at design-time, such as values in textual SNMP
Notification varbinds.

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>bad-user-input</code></summary>

* **Initial Perceived Severity**

* **Alarm message(s):**  
  * `Resource {resource} doesn't exist`

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>certificate-expiration</code></summary>
