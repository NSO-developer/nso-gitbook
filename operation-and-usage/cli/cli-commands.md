# CLI Commands

## Commands

To get a full XML listing of the commands available in a running NSO instance, use the `ncs` option `--cli-c-dump <file>`. The generated file is only intended for documentation purposes and cannot be used as input to the `ncsc` compiler. The command `show parser dump` can be used to get a command listing.

### Operational Mode Commands <a href="#d5e1943" id="d5e1943"></a>

#### Invoke an Action

<details>

<summary><code>&#x3C;path> &#x3C;parameters></code></summary>

Invokes the action found at `<path>` using the supplied parameters.

This command is auto-generated from the YANG file.

For example, given the following action specification in a YANG file:

```
tailf:action shutdown {
  tailf:actionpoint actions;
  input {
    tailf:constant-leaf flags {
      type uint64 {
        range "1 .. max";
      }
      tailf:constant-value 42;
    }
    leaf timeout {
      type xs:duration;
      default PT60S;
    }
    leaf message {
      type string;
    }
    container options {
      leaf rebootAfterShutdown {
        type boolean;
        default false;
      }
      leaf forceFsckAfterReboot {
        type boolean;
        default false;
      }
      leaf powerOffAfterShutdown {
        type boolean;
        default true;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The action can be invoked in the following way

```
admin@ncs> shutdown timeout 10s message reboot options { \
    forceFsckAfterReboot true }
```

</details>

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>show jobs</code></summary>

Display currently running background jobs.

Example:

```cli

JOB COMMAND
3   monitor start /var/log/messages
```

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>show parser dump &#x3C;command prefix></code></summary>

Shows all possible commands starting with the `<command prefix>`.

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>show running-config [ &#x3C;pathfilter> [ sort-by &#x3C;idx> ] ]</code></summary>

Display current configuration. By default, the whole configuration is displayed. It is possible to limit what is shown by supplying a pathfilter.

The `<pathfilter>` maybe either a path pointing to a specific instance or if an instance id is omitted, the part following the omitted instance is treated as a filter.

The `sort-by` argument can be given when the `<pathfilter>` points to a list element with secondary indexes. `<idx>` is the name of a secondary index. When given, the table will be sorted in the order defined by the secondary index. This makes it possible for the CLI user to control in which order instances should be displayed.

To show the `aaa` settings for the `admin` user:

```cli
admin@ncs# show running-config aaa authentication users user admin
aaa authentication users user admin
 uid        1000
 gid        1000
 password   $1$JA.1O3Tx$Zt1ycpnMlg1bVMqM/zSZ7/
 ssh_keydir /var/ncs/homes/admin/.ssh
 homedir    /var/ncs/homes/admin
!
```

To show all users that have group ID 1000, omit the user ID and instead specify `gid` `1000`:

<pre><code><strong>admin@ncs# show running-config aaa authentication users user * gid 1000
</strong>...
</code></pre>

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>show &#x3C;path> [ sort-by &#x3C;idx> ]</code></summary>

This command shows the configuration as a table provided that `<path>` leads to a list element and the data can be rendered as a table (ie, the table fits on the screen). It is also possible to force table formatting of a list by using the `| tab` pipe command.

The `sort-by` argument can be given when the _path_ points to a list element with secondary indexes. `<idx>` is the name of a secondary index. When given, the table will be sorted in the order defined by the secondary index. This makes it possible for the CLI user to control in which order instances should be displayed.

Example:

```cli
admin@ncs# show devices device ce0 module
NAME                       REVISION    FEATURE  DEVIATION
-----------------------------------------------------------
tailf-ned-cisco-ios        2015-03-16  -        -
tailf-ned-cisco-ios-stats  2015-03-16  -        -
```

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>source &#x3C;file></code></summary>

Execute commands from \<file> as if they had been entered by the user. The `autowizard` is disabled when executing commands from the file, also any commands that require input from the user (commands added by clispec, for example) will receive an interrupt signal upon attempt to read from stdin.

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>timecmd &#x3C;command></code></summary>

Time command. It measures and displays the execution time of `<command>`.

Note that this command will only be available if `devtools` has been set to `true` in the CLI session settings.

Example:

```cli
admin@ncs# timecmd id
user = admin(501), gid=20, groups=admin, gids=12,20,33,61,79,80,81,98,100
Command executed in 0.00 sec
admin@ncs#
```

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>who</code></summary>

Display currently logged-on users. The current session, i.e. the session running the show status command, is marked with an asterisk.

Example:

```cli
admin@ncs# who
Session User  Context From         Proto Date     Mode
 25     oper  cli     192.168.1.72 ssh   12:10:40 operational
*24     admin cli     192.168.1.72 ssh   12:05:50 operational
admin@ncs#
```

</details>

### Configure Mode Commands <a href="#d5e2199" id="d5e2199"></a>

#### **Configure a Value**

<details>

<summary><code>&#x3C;path> [&#x3C;value>]</code></summary>

Set a parameter. If a new identifier is created and `autowizard` is enabled, then the CLI will prompt the user for all mandatory sub-elements of that identifier.

This command is auto-generated from the YANG file.

If no `<value>` is provided, then the CLI will prompt the user for the value. No echo of the entered value will occur if `<path>` is an encrypted value, i.e. of the type `ianach:crypt-hash` or one of `md5-digest-string`, `aes-cfb-128-encrypted-string`, or `aes-256-cfb-128-encrypted-string` as documented in the `tailf-common.yang` data model.

For example to create a template from a part of a device config. First, configure the device then copy the config into the template configuration tree.

```cli
admin@ncs(config)# devices template host_temp
admin@ncs(config-template-host_temp)# exit
admin@ncs(config)# copy cfg merge devices device ce0 config \

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>insert &#x3C;path></code></summary>

Inserts a new element. If the element already exists and has the `indexedView` option set in the data model, then the old element will be renamed to element+1, and the new element will be inserted in its place.

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>insert &#x3C;path>[ first| last| before key| after key]</code></summary>

Inject a new element into an ordered list. The element can be added first, last (default), before or after another element.

<details>

<summary><code>load (merge | override | replace) (terminal | &#x3C;file>)</code></summary>

Load configuration from file or terminal.

* `merge`\
  Merge the content of the file/terminal with the current configuration.

<!---->

* `override`\
  Configuration from file/terminal overwrites the current configuration.

<!---->

* `replace`\
  Configuration from file/terminal replaces the current configuration.

If this is the current configuration:

```
devices device p1
 config
  cisco-ios-xr:interface GigabitEthernet 0/0/0/0
   shutdown
  exit
  cisco-ios-xr:interface GigabitEthernet 0/0/0/1
   shutdown
 !
!
```

The `shutdown` value for the entry `GigabitEthernet 0/0/0/0` should be deleted. As the configuration file is basically just a sequence of commands with comments in between, the configuration file should look like this:

```
devices device p1
 config
  cisco-ios-xr:interface GigabitEthernet 0/0/0/0
   no shutdown
  exit
 !
!
```

The file can then be used with the command ` load merge`` `` `_`FILENAME`_ to achieve the desired results.

</details>

For example, given a file with a device config it is possible to enter one device and issue the `rload merge/override/replace <file>` command to load the config for that device, then enter another device and load the same config file using `rload`. See also the `load` command.

* `merge`\
  Merge the content of the file/terminal with the current configuration.

<!---->

* `override`\
  Configuration from file/terminal overwrites the current configuration.

<!---->

* `replace`\

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>rollback-files apply-rollback-file (id | fixed-number)</code><br><code>&#x3C;number> [path &#x3C;path>] [selective]</code></summary>

Return the configuration to a previously committed configuration. The system stores a limited number of old configurations. The number of old configurations to store is configured in the `ncs.conf` file. If more than the configured number of configurations is stored, then the oldest configuration is removed before creating a new one.

The configuration changes are stored in rollback files where the most recent changes are stored in the file rollbackN with the highest number N.

Only the deltas are stored in the rollback files. When rolling back the configuration to rollback N, all changes stored in rollback10001-rollbackN are applied.

There are two ways to address which rollback file to use, either `fixed-number <number>` to address an absolute rollback number or `id <number>` to address a relative number. For e.g., the latest commit has relative rollback id 0, the second-latest has id 1, and so on.

The optional path argument allows subtrees to be rolled back while the rest of the configuration tree remains unchanged.

Instead of undoing all changes from rollback10001 to rollbackN it is possible to undo only the changes stored in a specific rollback file. This may or may not work depending on which changes have been made to the configuration after the rollback was created. In some cases applying the rollback file may fail, or the configuration may require additional changes in order to be valid. E.g. to undo the changes recorded in rollback 10019, but not the changes in 10020-N run the command `rollback-files apply-rollback-file selective fixed-number 10019`.

Example:

<pre><code><strong>admin@ncs(config)# rollback-files apply-rollback-file fixed-number 10005
</strong></code></pre>

This command is only available if rollback has been enabled in `ncs.conf`.

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>show full-configuration [&#x3C;pathfilter> [sort-by &#x3C;idx>]]</code></summary>

Show the current configuration, taking local changes into account. The `show` command can be limited to a part of the configuration by providing a `<pathfilter>`.

The `sort-by` argument can be given when the `<pathfilter>` points to a list element with secondary indexes. `<idx>` is the name of a secondary index. When given, the table will be sorted in the order defined by the secondary index. This makes it possible for the CLI user to control in which order instances should be displayed.

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>show configuration [&#x3C;pathfilter>]</code></summary>

Show current edits to the configuration.

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>show configuration merge [&#x3C;pathfilter> [sort-by &#x3C;idx>]]</code></summary>

Show the current configuration, taking local changes into account. The `show` command can be limited to a part of the configuration by providing a `<pathfilter>`.

The `sort-by` argument can be given when the `<pathfilter>` points to a list element with secondary indexes. `<idx>` is the name of a secondary index. When given, the table will be sorted in the order defined by the secondary index. This makes it possible for the CLI user to control in which order instances should be displayed.

</details>

<details>

<summary><code>show configuration commit changes [&#x3C;number> [&#x3C;path>]]</code></summary>

Display edits associated with a commit, identified by the rollback number created for the commit. The changes are displayed as forward changes, as opposed to `show configuration rollback changes` which displays the commands for undoing the changes.
