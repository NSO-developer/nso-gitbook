# Tools

The **Tools** view includes utilities that you can use to run specific tasks on your deployment, such as running compliance reports, etc.

<figure><img src="../../images/tools-view.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Tools View</p></figcaption></figure>

The following tools are available:

* [**Insights**](tools.md#d5e6470): Gathers and displays useful statistics of your deployment.
* [**Package upgrade**](tools.md#d5e6487): Used to perform upgrades to the packages running in NSO.
* [**High availability**](tools.md#d5e6538): Used to manage a High Availability (HA) setup in your deployment.
* [**Alarms**](tools.md#d5e6565): Shows current alarms/events in your deployment and provides options to manage them.
* [**Commit manager**](tools.md#d5e6582): Shortcut to the Commit Manager.
* [**Compliance reports**](tools.md#sec.webui_compliance): Used to run compliance checks on your NSO network.

## Insights <a href="#d5e6470" id="d5e6470"></a>

The **Insights** view collects and displays the following types of operational information using the `/ncs:metrics` data model to present useful statistics:

* Real-time data about transactions, commit queues, and northbound sessions.
* Sessions created and closed towards northbound interfaces since the last restart (CLI, JSON-RPC, NETCONF, RESTCONF, SNMP).
* Transactions since last restart (committed, aborted, and conflicting). You can select between the running and operational data stores.
* Devices and their sync statuses.
* CDB info about its size, compaction, etc.

## Package Upgrade <a href="#d5e6487" id="d5e6487"></a>

In the **Package upgrade** view, you can load custom packages in NSO.

The **Reload** button on the **Packages** pane is the equivalent of the **packages reload** command in CLI. Read more about the **reload** action in [NSO Packages](../operations/listing-packages.md).

### **Install a Package**

To install a new package:

1. In the **Package upgrade** view, click **Browse files** to select a new package (`.tar` or `.tar.gz`) from your local disk.
2. Click **Upload**. The package becomes visible under the **Available** pane.\
   (The **Progress Trace** shows the real-time progress of the upload).
3. Click **Install**.
4. On the **Loaded** pane, click **Reload** and confirm the intent.

### **Uninstall a Package**

To uninstall an existing package:

* To uninstall a package, simply click **Deinstall** next to the package in the **Loaded packages** list.

## High Availability <a href="#d5e6538" id="d5e6538"></a>

The **High Availability** view is used to visualize your HA setup (rule-based or Raft).

Actions can be performed on the cluster using the **Configuration editor** -> **Actions** tab. Possible actions are further described in the High Availability documentation under [Actions](../../administration/management/high-availability.md#d5e5031).

## Alarms <a href="#d5e6565" id="d5e6565"></a>

The **Alarm manager** view displays current alarms in the system. The alarms are categorized as **criticals**, **majors**, and **minors** and can be filtered by the device.

You can run actions on an alarm by selecting it and using the **run action** <img src="../../images/run-action.png" alt="" data-size="line"> button.

## Commit Manager <a href="#d5e6582" id="d5e6582"></a>

The **Commit manager** displays notifications about commits pending to be approved. Any time a change (a transaction) is made in NSO, the Commit Manager displays a notification to review the change. You can then choose to confirm or revert the commit.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Transactions and Commits**

Take special note of the Commit Manager. Whenever a transaction has started, the active configuration data changes can be inspected and evaluated before they are committed and pushed to the network. The data is saved to the NSO datastore and pushed to the network when a user presses **Commit**.

Any network-wide configuration change can be picked up as a rollback file. The rollback can then be applied to undo whatever happened to the network.
{% endhint %}

### **Review a Configuration Change**

To review a configuration change:

1. Access the Commit Manager by clicking its icon <img src="../../images/commit-manager.png" alt="" data-size="line"> in the banner.
2. Review the available changes appearing as **Current transaction**. If there are errors in the change, the Commit Manager alerts you and suggests possible corrections. You can then fix them and press **Re-validate** to clear the errors.
3. Click **Revert** to undo or **Commit** to confirm the changes in the transaction.
   * **Commit Options**: When committing a transaction, you have the possibility to choose **Commit options** and perform a commit with the specified commit option(s). Examples of commit options are: **No revision drop**, **No deploy**, **No networking**, etc. Commit options are described in detail in the JSON-RPC API documentation under [Methods - transaction - commit changes](../../development/advanced-development/web-ui-development/json-rpc-api.md#methods-transaction-commit-changes).

{% hint style="info" %}
In the **Commit manager** view, you can fetch additional information about the leaf by enabling **more node options** <img src="../../images/more-node-options.png" alt="" data-size="line"> and clicking the info <img src="../../images/info-button.png" alt="" data-size="line"> button.
{% endhint %}

#### **Load/Save Configuration Data**

Start a transaction to load or save configuration data using the **Load/Save** option, which you can then review for commit. The following tabs are available:

* **Rollback**: To load data that reverts an earlier change.
* **Files**: To load data from a local file on your disk.
* **Paste**: To load data by pasting it in.
* **Save**: To save loaded data to a file on your local disk.

#### **Commit Manager Tabs**

In the **Commit manager** view, the following tabs are shown.

* **changes** tab: To list the changes and actions done in the system, e.g., deleting a device or changing its properties.
* **errors** tab: To list the errors encountered while making changes. You can review the errors, make changes, and revalidate the error using the **Re-validate** option.
* **warnings** tab: To list the warnings encountered while making changes.
* **config** tab: To list the configuration changes associated with the change.
* **native config** tab: To list the device configuration data in the native config.
* **commit queue** tab: To manage commit queues. See [Commit Queue](../operations/nso-device-manager.md#user_guide.devicemanager.commit-queue) for more information.

## Compliance Reporting <a href="#sec.webui_compliance" id="sec.webui_compliance"></a>

The **Compliance reporting** view is used to create and run compliance reports to check the current situation, check historical events, or both. The conceptual aspects of the compliance reporting feature are discussed in greater depth in the [Compliance Reports](../operations/compliance-reporting.md) section.

{% hint style="success" %}
Web UI is the recommended way of running the compliance reports.
{% endhint %}

The following tabs are available in this view:

* **Compliance reports**
* **Report results**

### Compliance Reports
