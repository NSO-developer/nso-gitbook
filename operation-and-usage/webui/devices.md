# Devices

The **Devices** view provides options to manage devices, device groups, and authgroups in the NSO network.

## Device Management <a href="#d5e5752" id="d5e5752"></a>

The **Device management** view lists the devices in the network and provides options to manage them.

### **Search**

You can search for a device by its name, IP address, or other parameters. Narrow down the results by using the **Select device group** filter.

### **Add a Device**

To add a new device to NSO:

1. Click the **Add device** button.
2. In the **Add device** pop-up, specify the device name.
3. Click **Add**.
4. Configure the specifics of the device in the **Configuration editor**.
5. Review and commit the changes in the **Commit manager** when done.

### **Apply an Action on a Device**

Actions can be applied on a device from the **Device management** view or the **Configuration editor** -> **Actions** tab.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="From the Device Management View" %}
An action can be applied to a single or multiple devices at once.

1. Select the device(s) from the list using the checkbox.
2. Using the **Choose actions** button, select the desired action. The result of the action is returned momentarily.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the **Device management** view, you can also apply actions on a device using the more options <img src="../../images/more-options.png" alt="" data-size="line"> button.
{% endhint %}

**Actions Possible in the Device Management View**

Available actions include **Connect**, **Ping**, **Sync from**, **Sync to**, **Check sync**, **Compare config**, **Fetch ssh host keys**, and **Apply template**, and. See [Lifecycle Operations](../operations/lifecycle-operations.md) for the details of these actions.

{% hint style="info" %}
The other two tabs, i.e., **Config** and **Operdata** can be respectively used to:

* View the device configuration, and,
* View the device's operational data.
{% endhint %}

## Device Groups <a href="#d5e5978" id="d5e5978"></a>

The **Device groups** view lists all the available groups and devices belonging to them. You can add new device groups in this view as well as carry out actions on devices belonging to a group.

### **Create a Device Group**

Device groups allow for the grouping and collective management of devices.

1. Click **Add device group**.
2. In the **Create device group** pop-up, specify the group name.
   * If you want to place the new device group under a parent group, select the **Place under parent device group** option and specify the parent group.
3. Click **Create**. You will be redirected to the group's details page. Here, the following panes are available:
   * **Details**: Displays basic details of the group, i.e., its name and parent/subgroup information. To link a sub-group, use the **Connect sub device group** option.
   * **Devices in this group**: Displays currently added devices in the group and provides the option to remove them from the group.
   * **Add devices**: Displays all available NSO devices and provides the option to add them to the group.
4. In the **Add devices** pane, select the device(s) that you want to add to the new group and click **Add to device group**. The added devices become visible under the **Devices in this group** pane.
5. Finally, click **Create device group**.

### **Remove Device(s) from a Device Group**

1. Click the desired device group to access the group's detail page.
2. In the **Devices in this group** pane, select the device(s) to be removed from the group.
3. Click **Remove from device group**. The devices are removed immediately (without a Commit Manager review).
4. Click **Save device group**.

### **Apply an Action on a Device Group**

Device group actions let you perform an action on all the devices belonging to a group.

1. Select the desired device group from the list. It is possible to select multiple groups at once.
2. Choose the desired action from the **Choose actions** button.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the **Device groups** view, you can also apply actions on a device group using the more options <img src="../../images/more-options.png" alt="" data-size="line"> button.
{% endhint %}

**Actions Possible in the Device Groups View**

The available group actions are the same as in the section called [Apply an Action on a Device](devices.md#apply-an-action-on-a-device) (e.g., **Connect**, **Sync from**, **Sync to**, etc.) and are described in [Lifecycle Operations](../operations/lifecycle-operations.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Modify in Config editor** option is accessible by clicking the more options <img src="../../images/more-options.png" alt="" data-size="line"> button on a device group.

## Authgroups

The **Authgroups** view displays device authentication groups and provides ways to manage them. Concepts and settings involved in the authentication groups setup are discussed in [NSO Device Management](../operations/nso-device-manager.md#user_guide.devicemanager.authgroups).

This view is further partitioned into the following two tabs for different device types:

* The **Group** tab
* The **SNMP Group** tab

### Groups

The **Group** tab is used to view, search, and manage device authentication groups for CLI and NETCONF-managed devices.
