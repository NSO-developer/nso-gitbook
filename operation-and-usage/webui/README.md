# Web UI

The NSO Web UI provides an intuitive northbound interface to your NSO deployment. The UI consists of individual views, each with a different purpose, such as device management, service management, commit handling, etc.

The main components of the Web UI are shown in the figure below.

The UI works by auto-rendering the underlying device and service models. This gives the benefit that the Web UI is immediately updated when new devices or services are added to the system. For example, say you have added support for a new device vendor. Then, without any programming requirements, the NSO Web UI provides the capability to configure those devices.

It's important to realize that bulk of concepts and configuration options in Web UI are shared with the NSO CLI. The rest of the documentation covers these in detail. You need to be familiar with the fundamental concepts to work with the Web UI.

## Browser Requirements <a href="#d5e5676" id="d5e5676"></a>

All modern web browsers are supported and no plug-ins are needed. The interface itself is a JavaScript Client.

## Accessing the Web UI <a href="#d5e5679" id="d5e5679"></a>

By default, the Web UI is accessible on port 8080 of the NSO server for an NSO Local Install and port 8888 for a System Install. The port can be changed in the `ncs.conf` file. A user must authenticate before accessing the (web) UI.

### **Log In**

Log in to the NSO Web UI by using the username and password provided by your administrator. SSO SAML login is available if set up by your administrator. If applicable, use the SSO option to log in.

### **Log Out**

Log out by clicking your username on the top-right corner and choosing **Logout**.

### **Help Options**

Access the help options by clicking the help options icon in the UI banner. The following options are available:

* **Online documentation**: Access the Web UI's online help.
* **Config editor help**: Access help on using the configuration editor.
* **Manage hidden groups**: Administer hidden groups, e.g. for debugging. Read more about hide groups in [NSO CLI](../cli/introduction-to-nso-cli.md).
* **NSO version**: Information about the version of NSO you are running.

In the Web UI, supplementary help text, whenever applicable, is available on the configuration fields and can be accessed by clicking the info icons.

## Commit Manager <a href="#d5e5718" id="d5e5718"></a>

The Commit Manager is accessible at all times from the UI banner. Working with the Commit Manager is further described in [Tools](tools.md).
