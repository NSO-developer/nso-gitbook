# Learning Paths

There are many different ways of learning NSO. This site has many resources available that can help you along the way.

With NSO, we often talk about an automation journey. Similarly, there is a journey for a Service Developer as well. Several skills come together when using NSO:

* **NSO skills**: You must understand how NSO works and how to implement your services in NSO.
* **Networking**: You have to have an understanding of the service that is being configured.
* **Software development skills**: Depending on your language of choice, a bit of Java or Python knowledge is desirable. Java or Python multiprocessing skills for faster service deployment are helpful.
* **DevOps skills**: Understanding the processes around automating the network, setting up delivery pipelines, and continuous integration systems.

The focus of the material we are collecting here is on the NSO skills, but as you dive deeper into NSO, additional skills will also be needed in the other areas.

## Your Learning Journey with NSO

{% step %}
**The First Day**

We recommend that you start by going through the [NSO at a Glance](https://cisco-tailf.gitbook.io/nso-docs/nso-basics/nso-at-a-glance), [Installation and Deployment](https://cisco-tailf.gitbook.io/nso-docs/guides/administration/installation-and-deployment), [Introduction to Automation](https://cisco-tailf.gitbook.io/nso-docs/guides/development/introduction-to-automation), and [Learning Labs](https://developer.cisco.com/learning/tracks/get_started_with_nso/) while following along on your own NSO instance. Refer to the [NSO documentation](https://cisco-tailf.gitbook.io/nso-docs/guides) for any other things needed.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Next Steps**

After the first day, look at the additional interactive learning labs, sandboxes, and the extensive collection of examples available with the NSO distribution.

Also, consider [formal training from Cisco](https://learninglocator.cloudapps.cisco.com/#/search-results/NSO).

**Continue to Learn**

Learning never stops. Once you feel confident with the basics, join our community and read our blogs to follow the development of the community. One good resource for examples and inspiration is the [NSO GitHub](https://github.com/NSO-developer/) and [NSO GitLab](https://gitlab.com/NSO-developer/) pages.
