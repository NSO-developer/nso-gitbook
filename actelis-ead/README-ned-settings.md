# NED settings details
----------------------

  This NED is equipped with a number of runtime configuration options "NED settings" allowing for
  customization by the end user. All options are configurable using the NSO API for NED settings.
  Most NED settings can be configured globally, per device profile or per device instance in the
  following locations:

  global
    /ncs:devices/global-settings/ned-settings/actelis-ead/
  profile
    /ncs:devices/ncs:profiles/profile:<name>/ned-settings/actelis-ead/
  device
    /ncs:/device/devices/device:<name>/ned-settings/actelis-ead/

  Profiles setting overrides global-settings and device settings override profile settings,
  hence the narrowest scope of the setting is used by the device.

  If user changes a ned-setting, then user must reconnect to the device, i.e.
  disconnect and connect in order for the new setting to take effect.

  From the NSO CLI the device instance NED settings for this NED are available under:

   ```
   # config
   # devices device dev-1 ned-settings actelis-ead

   Press TAB to see all the NED settings.

   ```

# 1. ned-settings actelis-ead
-----------------------------


    - actelis-ead extended-parser <enum> (default auto)

      Make the NED handle CLI parsing (i.e. transform the running-config from the device to the
      model based config tree).

      disabled        - Load configuration the standard way.

      turbo-mode      - The NED executes the whole command parsing by itself, completely bypassing
                        the NSO CLI parser. The configuration dump is transferred to NSO using maapi
                        setvalues call.

      turbo-xml-mode  - The NED executes the whole command parsing by itself, completely bypassing
                        the NSO CLI parser. The configuration dump is transferred to NSO in XML
                        format.

      robust-mode     - Makes the NED filter the configuration so that unmodeled content is removed
                        before being passed to the NSO CLI-engine. This protects against
                        configuration ending up at the wrong level when NSO CLI parser fallbacks
                        (which potentially can cause following config to be skipped).

      auto            - Uses turbo-mode when available, will use fastest availablemethod to load
                        data to NSO. If NSO doesn't support data-loading from CLI NED, robust-mode
                        is used.


# 2. ned-settings actelis-ead proxy
-----------------------------------

  Configure NED to access device via a proxy.


    - proxy remote-connection <enum>

      Connection type between proxy and device.

      ssh     - ssh.

      telnet  - telnet.

      serial  - serial.


    - proxy remote-address <union>

      Address of host behind the proxy.


    - proxy remote-port <uint16>

      Port of host behind the proxy.


    - proxy remote-name <string>

      User name on the device behind the proxy.


    - proxy remote-password <string>

      Password on the device behind the proxy.


    - proxy proxy-prompt <string>

      Prompt pattern on the proxy host before connecting to device.


    - proxy remote-ssh-args <string>

      Additional arguments used to establish proxy connection.


# 3. ned-settings actelis-ead connection
----------------------------------------

  Configure settings specific to the connection between NED and device.


    - connection number-of-retries <uint8> (default 0)

      Configure max number of retries the NED will try to connect to the device before giving up.
      Default 0.


    - connection time-between-retry <uint8> (default 1)

      Configure the time in seconds the NED will wait between each connect retry. Default 1s.


    - connection commands meta-data <WORD>

      Change the default connector. Default 'ned-connector.json'.


    - connection commands initial-action <union>

      Interactor action used to initialize a connection.


    - connection commands awaken-console <string>

      Command sent to awaken console during connection.


    - connection commands send-delay <uint32> (default 0)

      Delay in ms before sending a command during connection.


    - connection commands expect-timeout <uint32> (default 60000)

      Default limit in ms for waiting for command response.


# 4. ned-settings actelis-ead live-status
-----------------------------------------

  Configure NED settings related to live-status.


    - live-status time-to-live <int32> (default 50)

      Define time-to-live for data fetched from the device via live-status.(default 50).


# 5. ned-settings actelis-ead logger
------------------------------------

  Settings for controlling logs generated.


    - logger level <enum> (default info)

      Set level of logging.

      error    - error.

      info     - info.

      verbose  - verbose.
