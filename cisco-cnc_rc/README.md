# 1. General
------------

  This document describes the cisco-cnc_rc NED.

  This is a RESTCONF NED to be used together with the Cisco CNC platform

  The NED has been successfully tested with the following CNC versions:
      - 6.1.4

  IMPORTANT:
  This NED is delivered without any of the device YANG models bundled to the NED package.

  It is required to download the YANG files separately and rebuild the NED package before the NED is
  fully operational. See the README-rebuild.md for further information.

  The recommended way to do this is by following the steps below:

   1. Install and setup the NED. See chapter 1.1 to 1.3
   2. Download the YANG models. See chapter 1.1 in README-rebuild.md for the recommended method (alternatives are described in
      README-rebuild.md chapter 2 and 3).
   3. Rebuild the NED. See chapter 1.3 in README-rebuild.md (an alternative with a custom NED-ID is described in README-rebuild.md chapter 4).
   4. Reload the NED in NSO. See chapter 1.4 in README-rebuild.md

  ```


## 1.1 Extract the NED package
------------------------------

  It is assumed the NED package `ncs-<NSO version>-cisco-cnc_rc-<NED version>.signed.bin` has already
  been downloaded from software.cisco.com.

  In this instruction the following example settings will be used:

  - NSO version: 6.0
  - NED version: 1.0.1
  - NED package downloaded to: /tmp/ned-package-store

  1. Extract the NED package and verify its signature:

      ```
      > cd /tmp/ned-package-store
      > chmod u+x ncs-6.0-cisco-cnc_rc-1.0.1.signed.bin
      > ./ncs-6.0-cisco-cnc_rc-1.0.1.signed.bin
      ```

  2. In case the signature can not be verified (for instance if no internet connection),
     do as below instead:

      ```
      > ./ncs-6.0-cisco-cnc_rc-1.0.1.signed.bin --skip-verification
      ```

  3. The result of the extraction shall be a tar.gz file with the same name as the .bin file:

      ```
      > ls *.tar.gz
      ncs-6.0-cisco-cnc_rc-1.0.1.tar.gz
      ```


## 1.2 Install the NED package
------------------------------

  There are two alternative ways to install this NED package.
  Which one to use depends on how NSO itself is setup.

  In the instructions below the following example settings will be used:

  - NSO version: 6.0
  - NED version: 1.0.1
  - NED download directory: /tmp/ned-package-store
  - NSO run time directory: ~/nso-lab-rundir

  A prerequisite is to set the environment variable NSO_RUNDIR to point at the NSO run time directory:

  ```
  > export NSO_RUNDIR=~/nso-lab-rundir
  ```

  **IMPORTANT**:

  This NED is delivered as an “empty” package, i.e without any device YANG models bundled.
  It must be rebuilt with the device YANG models to become operational.

  The procedure to rebuild the empty NED (described in the README-rebuild.md) shall typically
  be done in a lab environment. For this step a “local install” of the NED shall be used.
  It is not suitable to use “system install” here since it is intended for production systems only.

  Once this NED has been rebuilt with the device YANG and exported to one or many
  separate tar.gz customized NED packages, a “system installation” can be used on them.


### 1.2.1 Local install
-----------------------

  This section describes how to install a NED package on a locally installed NSO
  (see "NSO Local Install" in the NSO Installation guide).

  It is assumed the NED package has been been unpacked to a tar.gz file as described in 1.1.

  1. Untar the tar.gz file. This creates a new sub-directory named:
     `cisco-cnc_rc-<NED major digit>.<NED minor digit>`:

     ```
     > tar xfz ncs-6.0-cisco-cnc_rc-1.0.1.tar.gz
     > ls -d */
     cisco-cnc_rc-gen-1.0
     ```

  2. Install the NED into NSO, using the ncs-setup tool:

     ```
     > ncs-setup --package cisco-cnc_rc-gen-1.0 --dest $NSO_RUNDIR
     ```

  3. Open a NSO CLI session and load the new NED package like below:

     ```
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin
     admin@ncs# packages reload
     reload-result {
         package cisco-cnc_rc-gen-1.0
         result true
     }
     ```

  Alternatively the tar.gz file can be installed directly into NSO. Then skip steps 1 and 2 and do like
  below instead:

  ```
    > ncs-setup --package ncs-6.0-cisco-cnc_rc-1.0.1.tar.gz --dest $NSO_RUNDIR
    > ncs_cli -C -u admin
    admin@ncs# packages reload
    reload-result {
      package cisco-cnc_rc-gen-1.0
      result true
   }
  ```

  Set the environment variable NED_ROOT_DIR to point at the NSO NED package:

  ```
  > export NED_ROOT_DIR=$NSO_RUNDIR/packages/cisco-cnc_rc-gen-1.0
  ```


### 1.2.2 System install
------------------------

  This section describes how to install a NED package on a system installed NSO (see "NSO System
  Install" in the NSO Installation Guide).

  It is assumed the NED package has been been unpacked to a tar.gz file as described in 1.1.

  1. Do a NSO backup before installing the new NED package:

     ```
     > $NCS_DIR/bin/ncs-backup
     ```

  2. Start a NSO CLI session and fetch the NED package:

     ```
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin
     admin@ncs# software packages fetch package-from-file \
               /tmp/ned-package-store/ncs-6.0-cisco-cnc_rc-1.0.tar.gz
     admin@ncs# software packages list
     package {
      name ncs-6.0-cisco-cnc_rc-1.0.tar.gz
      installable
     }
     ```

  3. Install the NED package (add the argument replace-existing if a previous version has been loaded):

     ```
     admin@ncs# software packages install cisco-cnc_rc-1.0
     admin@ncs# software packages list
     package {
      name ncs-6.0-cisco-cnc_rc-1.0.tar.gz
      installed
     }
     ```

  4. Load the NED package

     ```
     admin@ncs# packages reload
     admin@ncs# software packages list
     package {
       name ncs-6.0-cisco-cnc_rc-gen-1.0
       loaded
     }
     ```


## 1.3 Configure the NED in NSO
-------------------------------

  This section describes the steps for configuring a device instance
  using the newly installed NED package.

  - Start a NSO CLI session:

    ```
    > ncs_cli -C -u admin
    ```

  - Enter configuration mode:

    ```
    admin@ncs# configure
    Entering configuration mode terminal
    admin@ncs(config)#
    ```

  - Configure a new authentication group (my-group) to be used for this device:

    ```
    admin@ncs(config)# devices authgroup group my-group default-map remote-name <user name on device> \
                       remote-password <password on device>
    ```

  - Configure a new device instance (example: dev-1):

    ```
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 address <ip address to device>
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 port <port on device>
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 device-type generic ned-id cisco-cnc_rc-gen-1.0
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 state admin-state unlocked
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 authgroup my-group
    ```
    **IMPORTANT**:

    The *device-type* shall always be set to *generic* when configuring a device instance
    to use a 3PY NED. A common mistake is configuring it as *netconf*, which will cause
    NSO to use its internal netconf client instead.


  Additional configurations:

  - SSL/TLS:

    Set up SSL/TLS configurables if needed.

    Enable TLS:

    Configure Server TLS authentication:

     Alt 1:

      Accept any SSL certificate presented by the device. This is unsafe and should only be used for
      testing purposes.

      In the NSO CLI:
      ```
      # devices device dev-1 ned-settings cisco-cnc_rc connection ssl accept-any true
      ```

    Alt 2:

      Configure a TLS/SSL certificate. Either a host certificate identifying the device or
      a self signed root CA. The certificate shall be entered in DER Base64 format, which
      is the same as the PEM format but without the banners \"----- BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\"
      etc.

      Use the Unix tool 'openssl' to fetch the PEM certificate from a device:

      In a Unix shell:
      ```
      > openssl s_client -connect <device address>:<port>
      ```

      In the NSO CLI:
      ```
      # devices device dev-1 ned-settings cisco-cnc_rc connection ssl certificate <enter>
      <The pasted Base64 binary>
      ```

  - Mutual TLS:

    Configure cerificate, private key and possibly key passphrase to be used by the NED
    to identify itself for the device.

    The certificate and private key shall be entered in DER Base64 format. I.e same as PEM
    format but without the banners  is the same as the PEM format but without the banners
    like \"----- BEGIN|END CERTIFICATE-----\", \"----- BEGIN|END PRIVATE KEY-----\" etc

    In the NSO CLI:

    ```
    # devices device dev-1 ned-settings cisco-cnc_rc connection ssl mtls client certificate <enter>
    <The pasted Base64 certificate binary>

    # devices device dev-1 ned-settings cisco-cnc_rc connection ssl mtls client private-key <enter>
    <The pasted Base64 private key binary>

    Optionally:
    # devices device dev-1 ned-settings cisco-cnc_rc connection ssl mtls client key-password <password>
    ```


  - Customize RESTCONF settings:

    <u>YANG-PATCH</u>
    The NED is by default configured to use the YANG-PATCH protocol when deploying config on the Cisco CNC.
    YANG-PATCH is a recent addition to the RESTCONF protocol, which is supported by the Cisco CNC. The
    biggest benefit with YANG-PATCH is that it makes the deployment atomical and reduces the number of
    required round trips towards the device.

    The NED can easily be re-configured to use the standard RESTCONF protocol instead. See the
    README-ned-settings.md for further details.

    <u>CHECK-SYNC</u>
    The NED is by default configured to support the NSO check-sync feature. This is done by doing a hash
    of the config received from the Cisco CNC.

    The NED can easily be re-configured to disable the check-sync feature completely.
    See the README-ned-settings.md for further details.

  - Finally commit the configuration

    ```
    admin@ncs(config)# commit
    ```

  - Verify configuration, using a sync-from.

    ```
    admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 sync-from
    result true
    ```

  If the sync-from was not successful, check the NED configuration again.


# 2. Optional debug and trace setup
-----------------------------------

  It is often desirable to see details from when and how the NED interacts with the device(Example: troubleshooting)

  This can be achieved by configuring NSO to generate a trace file for the NED. A trace file
  contains information about all interactions with the device. Messages sent and received as well
  as debug printouts, depending on the log level configured.

  NSO creates one separate trace file for each device instance with tracing enabled.
  Stored in the following location:

  `$NSO_RUNDIR/logs/ned-cisco-cnc_rc-gen-1.0-<device name>.trace`

  Do as follows to enable tracing in one specific device instance in NSO:


  1. Start a NSO CLI session:

     ```
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin
     ```

  2. Enter configuration mode:

     ```
     admin@ncs# configure
     Entering configuration mode terminal
     admin@ncs(config)#
     ```

  3. Enable trace raw:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 trace raw
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

     Alternatively, tracing can be enabled globally affecting all configured device instances:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices global-settings trace raw
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  4. Configure the log level for printouts to the trace file:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 ned-settings cisco-cnc_rc logger \
                       level [debug | verbose | info | error]
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

     Alternatively the log level can be set globally affecting all configured
     device instances using this NED package.

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device global-settings ned-settings cisco-cnc_rc logger \
                       level [debug | verbose | info | error]
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  The log level 'info' is used by default and the 'debug' level is the most verbose.

  **IMPORTANT**:
  Tracing shall be used with caution. This feature does increase the number of IPC messages sent
  between the NED and NSO. In some cases this can affect the performance in NSO. Hence, tracing should
  normally be disabled in production systems.


  An alternative method for generating printouts from the NED is to enable the Java logging mechanism.
  This makes the NED print log messages to common NSO Java log file.

  `$NSO_RUNDIR/logs/ncs-java-vm.log`

  Do as follows to enable Java logging in the NED

  1. Start a NSO CLI session:

     ```
     > ncs_cli -C -u admin
     ```

  2. Enter configuration mode:

     ```
     admin@ncs# configure
     Entering configuration mode terminal
     admin@ncs(config)#
     ```

  3. Enable Java logging with level all from the NED package:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# java-vm java-logging logger com.tailf.packages.ned.cnc \
                       level level-all
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  4. Configure the NED to log to the Java logger

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 ned-settings cisco-cnc_rc logger java true
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

     Alternatively Java logging can be enabled globally affecting all configured
     device instances using this NED package.

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices global-settings ned-settings cisco-cnc_rc logger java true
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  **IMPORTANT**:
  Java logging does not use any IPC messages sent to NSO. Consequently, NSO performance is not
  affected. However, all log printouts from all log enabled devices are saved in one single file.
  This means that the usability is limited. Typically single device use cases etc.

# 3. Dependencies
-----------------

  This NED has the following host environment dependencies:

  - Java 1.8 (NSO version < 6.2)
  - Java 17 (NSO version >= 6.2)
  - Gnu Sed

  Dependencies for NED recompile:

   - Apache Ant
   - Bash
   - Gnu Sort
   - Gnu awk
   - Grep
   - Python3 (with packages: re, sys, getopt, subprocess, argparse, os, glob)


# 4. Sample device configuration
--------------------------------

  devices device cnc-1
   address   <ip address>
   port      <port, usually 30603>
   authgroup cnc-1
   device-type generic ned-id cisco-cnc_rc-gen-1.0
   ned-settings cisco-cnc_rc connection ssl accept-any true
   state admin-state unlocked
  !

  In many cases it is beneficial to let the NED cache the bearer token as well as the probed
  list of YANG modules and capabilities. This will reduce the number of required round trips to the device and increase the NED performance.

  devices device cnc-1
   ned-settings cisco-cnc_rc connection authentication use-token-cache true
   ned-settings cisco-cnc_rc restconf cache model enabled
   ned-settings cisco-cnc_rc restconf cache capability enabled
  !

# 6. Built in live-status show
------------------------------

  This NED has full support for fetching operational data via the NSO live-status API.


# 7. Limitations
----------------

  NONE


# 8. How to report NED issues and feature requests
--------------------------------------------------

  **Issues like bugs and errors shall always be reported to the Cisco NSO NED team through
  the Cisco Support channel:**

  - <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/index.html>
  - <https://developer.cisco.com/docs/nso/#!support/network-service-orchestrator-support>

  The following information is required for the Cisco NSO NED team to be able
  to investigate an issue:

    - A detailed recipe with steps to reproduce the issue.
    - A raw trace file generated when the issue is reproduced.
    - Access to a device where the issue can be reproduced by the Cisco NSO NED team.
      This typically means both read and write permissions are required.
      Pseudo access via tools like Webex, Zoom etc is not acceptable.
      However, it is ok with device access through VPNs, jump servers etc though.

  Do as follows to gather the necessary information needed for your device, here named 'dev-1':

  1. Enable full debug logging in the NED

     ```
     ncs_cli -C -u admin
     admin@ncs# configure
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 ned-settings cisco-cnc_rc logging level debug
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  2. Configure the NSO to generate a raw trace file from the NED

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 trace raw
     admin@ncs(config)# commit
     ```

  3. If the NED already had trace enabled, clear it in order to submit only relevant information

     Do as follows for NSO 6.4 or newer:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 clear-trace
     ```

     Do as follows for older NSO versions:

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices clear-trace
     ```

  4. Run a compare-config to populate the trace with initial device config

     ```
     admin@ncs(config)# devices device dev-1 compare-config
     ```

  5. Reproduce the found issue using ncs_cli or your NSO service.
     Write down each necessary step in a reproduction report.

  6. Gather the reproduction report and a copy of the raw trace file
     containing data recorded when the issue happened.

  7. Contact the Cisco support and request to open a case. Provide the gathered files
     together with access details for a device that can be used by the
     Cisco NSO NED when investigating the issue.


  **Requests for new features and extensions of the NED are handled by the Cisco NSO NED team when
  applicable. Such requests shall also go through the Cisco support channel.**

  The following information is required for feature requests and extensions:

  1. A detailed use case description, with details like:
     - Data of interest
     - The kind of operations to be used on the data. Like: 'read', 'create', 'update', 'delete'
       and the order of the operation
     - Device APIs involved in the operations (For example: REST URLs and payloads)
     - Device documentation describing the operations involved

  2. Run sync-from # devices device dev-1 sync-from (if relevant)

  3. Attach the raw trace to the ticket (if relevant)

  4. Access to a device that can be used by the Cisco NSO NED team for testing and verification
     of the new feature. This usually means that both read and write permissions are required.
     Pseudo access via tools like Webex, Zoom etc is not acceptable. However, it is ok with access
     through VPNs, jump servers etc.


# 9. How to rebuild a NED
--------------------------

  Check the README-rebuild.md file, chapter 1.3, for more information.


# 10. Using NETSIM for testing
-----------------------------

  NETSIM (ConfD) has a built in RESTCONF server and can easily be configured as a test device.

  Configure a NETSIM device instance in NSO like below:

  ```
  devices authgroups group netsim-0
  default-map remote-name admin
  default-map remote-password admin
  !
  devices device netsim-0
   address 127.0.0.1
   port 7080
   authgroup netsim-0
   device-type generic ned-id cisco-cnc_rc-gen-2.0
   trace     raw
   state admin-state unlocked
   ned-settings cisco-cnc_rc restconf profile netsim
  !
  ```
