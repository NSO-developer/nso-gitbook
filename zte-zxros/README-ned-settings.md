# NED settings details
----------------------

  This NED is equipped with a number of runtime configuration options "NED settings" allowing for
  customization by the end user. All options are configurable using the NSO API for NED settings.
  Most NED settings can be configured globally, per device profile or per device instance in the
  following locations:

  global
    /ncs:devices/global-settings/ned-settings/zte-zxros/
  profile
    /ncs:devices/ncs:profiles/profile:<name>/ned-settings/zte-zxros/
  device
    /ncs:/device/devices/device:<name>/ned-settings/zte-zxros/

  Profiles setting overrides global-settings and device settings override profile settings,
  hence the narrowest scope of the setting is used by the device.

  If user changes a ned-setting, then user must reconnect to the device, i.e.
  disconnect and connect in order for the new setting to take effect.

  From the NSO CLI the device instance NED settings for this NED are available under:

   ```
   # config
   # devices device dev-1 ned-settings zte-zxros

   Press TAB to see all the NED settings.

   ```

# 1. ned-settings zte-zxros
---------------------------


    - zte-zxros extended-parser <enum> (default auto)

      Make the cisco-nx NED handle CLI parsing (i.e. transform the running-config from the device to
      the model based config tree).

      auto            - Uses turbo-mode when available, will use fastest availablemethod to load
                        data to NSO.

      turbo-mode      - The NED executes the whole command parsing by itself, completely bypassing
                        the NSO CLI parser. The configuration dump is transferred to NSO using maapi
                        setvalues call.

      turbo-xml-mode  - The NED executes the whole command parsing by itself, completely bypassing
                        the NSO CLI parser. The configuration dump is transferred to NSO in XML
                        format.
